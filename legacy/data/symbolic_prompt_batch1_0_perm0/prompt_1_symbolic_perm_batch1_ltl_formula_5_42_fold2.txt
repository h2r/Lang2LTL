Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: stop by a
LTL: F a

Utterance: go to a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: move to abcand a in any order
LTL: & F c & F b & F d F a

Utterance: visit h c a d and b
LTL: & F h & F c & F a & F d F b

Utterance: move to b then move to a
LTL: F & b F a

Utterance: go to b  then visit c then reach a
LTL: F & b F & c F a

Utterance: go to b then go to c then go to d and then go to a
LTL: F & b F & c F & d F a

Utterance: you have to walk to h and then walk to c and then walk to a and then walk to d and finally walk to b
LTL: F & h F & c F & a F & d F b

Utterance: go to b but not through a or c and then go to a but not through c and finally go to c
LTL: & U ! a b & U ! c a F c

Utterance: go to b only after that go to c only then go to d and only then go to a
LTL: & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! a d F a

Utterance: do not go to b until d is visited and do not go to d until a is visited and do not go to a until c is visited and do not go to c until h is visited
LTL: & U ! c h & U ! a c & U ! d a & U ! b d F b

Utterance: move to b exactly once while avoiding a then find a
LTL: & & U ! a b F a U ! b U b U !b a

Utterance: visit c a and b in this order without skipping any one of them do not revisit any one of them once after you have been there
LTL: & & U ! a c & U ! b a F b & U ! c U c U !c a U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: visit d a c and b in this order without skipping any one of them do not revisit any one of them once after you have been there
LTL: & & U ! a d & U ! c a & U ! b c F b & U ! d U d U !d a & U ! a U a U !a c U ! c U c U !c b

Utterance: do not stop visiting a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: make sure b a and c are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F b & G F a G F c

Utterance: make sure b c d and a are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F b & G F c & G F d G F a

Utterance:
