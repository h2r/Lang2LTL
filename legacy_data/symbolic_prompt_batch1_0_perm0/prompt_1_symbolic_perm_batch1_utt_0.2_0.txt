LTL: & F c & F b F a

Utterance: visit b c d and a the order is not important

Utterance: make your way to d h a c and b
LTL: & F d & F h & F a & F c F b

Utterance: go to a and sometime afterward visit b
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: go to b and go to c after b is visited and go to a after b and c are visited
LTL: F & b F & c F a

Utterance: you have to walk to b and then walk to a and then walk to d and finally walk to c
LTL: F & b F & a F & d F c

Utterance: visit d h c a and b sequentially

Utterance: go to a but only visit a if you already visited b
LTL: & U ! a b F a

Utterance: visit b c and a in order but keep avoiding latter ones when you are heading to former ones
LTL: & U ! c b & U ! a c F a

Utterance: visit d a c and b in this order without skipping any one of them
LTL: & U ! a d & U ! c a & U ! b c F b

Utterance: go to d h c a and b in that specific order
LTL: & U ! h d & U ! c h & U ! a c & U ! b a F b

Utterance: go to b exactly once while avoiding a then go to a
LTL: & & U ! a b F a U ! b U b U !b a

Utterance: go to b but not through c or a and then go to c but not through a and finally go to a no revisiting is allowed
LTL: & & U ! c b & U ! a c F a & U ! b U b U !b c U ! c U c U !c a

Utterance: visit d b c and a in this order without skipping any one of them do not revisit any one of them once after you have been there
LTL: & & U ! b d & U ! c b & U ! a c F a & U ! d U d U !d b & U ! b U b U !b c U ! c U c U !c a

Utterance: visit d then a then h then c and then b visit each landmark only once
LTL: & & U ! a d & U ! h a & U ! c h & U ! b c F b & U ! d U d U !d a & U ! a U a U !a h & U ! h U h U !h c U ! c U c U !c b

Utterance: please visit a infinitely often
LTL: G F a

Utterance: frequent b and a infinitely in any order
LTL: & G F b G F a

Utterance: never stop visiting a b and c
LTL: & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: keep visiting b d a and c in any order
LTL: & G F b & G F d & G F a G F c

Utterance: make sure c b d a and h are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F c & G F b & G F d & G F a G F h
