Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: walk to b
LTL: F b

Utterance: go to b and h in any order
LTL: & F b F h

Utterance: visit all three locations h a and b
LTL: & F h & F a F b

Utterance: make sure to visit h a c and b in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: go to h c b d and a at least once
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: go to b and then to h
LTL: F & b F h

Utterance: go to h then visit a then reach b
LTL: F & h F & a F b

Utterance: go to h then go to c then go to a and then go to d
LTL: F & h F & c F & a F d

Utterance: visit h followed by a then b then c and then d
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: go to h at least once while avoiding c and a then go to c at least once while avoiding a finally go to a
LTL: & U ! c h & U ! a c F a

Utterance: go to b without visiting h then go to h without going to b again
LTL: & & U ! h b F h U ! b U b U ! b h

Utterance: visit c but before visiting c you must visit h only after that visit a visit each location once
LTL: & & U ! c h & U ! a c F a & U ! h U h U ! h c U ! c U c U ! c a

Utterance: go to h only once but keep away from c a and d and then go to c only once but keep away from h a and d and then go to a only once but keep way from h c and d and finally go to d once but keep away from h c and a
LTL: & & U ! c h & U ! a c & U ! d a F d & U ! h U h U ! h c & U ! c U c U ! c a U ! a U a U ! a d

Utterance: visit h a b c and d in that exact order once you leave any location you can not return to it
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! h U h U ! h a & U ! a U a U ! a b & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c d

Utterance: go to b while avoiding h then go to h
LTL: & U ! h b F h

Utterance: continue moving to b
LTL: G F b

Utterance: first go to h while avoiding c then go to c while staying away from a then go to a while staying away from d then visit d
LTL: & U ! c h & U ! a c & U ! d a F d

Utterance: go to h c a d and b in that specific order
LTL: & U ! c h & U ! a c & U ! d a & U ! b d F b

Utterance: go to h b and a an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F h & G F a G F b

Utterance: keep going to h a b and c in any order
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: keep going to h a b c and d in any order
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F b & G F c G F d

Utterance: do not stop visiting b and h
LTL: & G F b G F h

Utterance: b should never become true
LTL: G ! b

Utterance: do not ever visit both b and h
LTL: & G ! b G ! h

Utterance: always keep away from h a and b
LTL: & G ! h & G ! a G ! b

Utterance: always keep away from h a b and c
LTL: & G ! h & G ! a & G ! b G ! c

Utterance: always keep away from h a b c and d
LTL: & G ! h & G ! a & G ! b & G ! c G ! d

Utterance: you can not go to b until you go to h
LTL: U ! b h

Utterance: the maximum allowable separate visits to b is one
LTL: ! F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: you are not permitted to visit b any more than two distinct times
LTL: ! F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: do not go to b on any more than three occasions
LTL: ! F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: do not visit b more than four times
LTL: ! F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: make sure to not visit b on any more than five separate occasions
LTL: ! F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: you are required to pass through b once
LTL: F b

Utterance: you are not allowed to have any less than two separate visits to b complete the task
LTL: F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: make sure to not visit b any fewer than three times
LTL: F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: you are not permitted to complete the task without visiting b on four separate occasions
LTL: F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: ensure that you have at least five separate times where you reach b
LTL: F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: go visit b exactly once
LTL: M b | ! b G | b G ! b

Utterance: ensure that you have exactly two distinct visits to b
LTL: M & b F & ! b F b | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G ! b

Utterance: do not exceed or fall short on three separate visits to b
LTL: M & b F & ! b F & b F & ! b F b | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G ! b

Utterance: do not go to b any more or any fewer than four different times
LTL: M & b F & ! b F & b F & ! b F & b F & ! b F b | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G ! b

Utterance: visit b at most and at least five separate times
LTL: M & b F & ! b F & b F & ! b F & b F & ! b F & b F & ! b F b | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G ! b

Utterance: after you get to b you must avoid h
LTL: G i b X G ! h

Utterance: whenever you see b occur make sure to visit h at least once after
LTL: G i b F h

Utterance: you must be at h at the next time step if and only if you have seen b hold true
LTL: G e b X h

Utterance: as long as you do not see h happen do not leave b
LTL: U b h

Utterance: whenever you observe b proceed to go to reach h at the next time instant
LTL: G i b X h

Utterance:
