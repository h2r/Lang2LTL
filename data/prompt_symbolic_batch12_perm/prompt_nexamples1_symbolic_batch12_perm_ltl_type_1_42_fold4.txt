Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: reach d
LTL: F d

Utterance: go to d and c in any order
LTL: & F d F c

Utterance: you must go to c h and a at least once
LTL: & F h & F a F c

Utterance: visit h go to a reach c reach d
LTL: & F h & F a & F c F d

Utterance: make sure you go to h a c d b in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F c & F d F b

Utterance: find d first then find c
LTL: F & d F c

Utterance: go to h then go to a then go to c
LTL: F & h F & a F c

Utterance: first go to h then visit a then move to c finally reach d
LTL: F & h F & a F & c F d

Utterance: visit h then a then c then d and finally b
LTL: F & h F & a F & c F & d F b

Utterance: first go to h while staying away from a then go to a while staying away from c finally visit c
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! c a F c

Utterance: go to d and then go to c but do not visit c before d is visited
LTL: & U ! c d F c

Utterance: please visit d infinitely often
LTL: G F d

Utterance: first go directly to h without visiting any other waypoints then go directly to a then directly to b and finally directly to c
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: visit h a b c and d in this order without skipping any one of them
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: travel to a c and h infinitely
LTL: & G F h & G F a G F c

Utterance: keep visiting h a c and d an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F c G F d

Utterance: keep visiting h a c d and b an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F c & G F d G F b

Utterance: make sure b and h are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F b G F h
