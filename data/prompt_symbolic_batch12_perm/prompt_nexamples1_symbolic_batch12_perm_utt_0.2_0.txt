Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: visit b
LTL: F b

Utterance: eventually reach b and h
LTL: & F b F h

Utterance: go to h a and b
LTL: & F h & F a F b

Utterance: make sure to visit h a c and b in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: go to h c b d and a at least once
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: move to b then move to h
LTL: F & b F h

Utterance: visit a at least once after going to h and visit b at least once after going to a
LTL: F & h F & a F b

Utterance: visit c at least once after visiting h visit a at least once after visiting h and c visit d at least once after visiting h c and a
LTL: F & h F & c F & a F d

Utterance: visit h followed by a then b then c and then d
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: visit h at least once then visit c at least once finally visit a do not visit c or a before h do not visit a before c
LTL: & U ! c h & U ! a c F a

Utterance: only visit b once and do not visit h until you visit b
LTL: & & U ! h b F h U ! b U b U ! b h

Utterance: visit c but before visiting c you must visit h only after that visit a visit each location once
LTL: & & U ! c h & U ! a c F a & U ! h U h U ! h c U ! c U c U ! c a

Utterance: go to h only once but keep away from c a and d and then go to c only once but keep away from h a and d and then go to a only once but keep way from h c and d and finally go to d once but keep away from h c and a
LTL: & & U ! c h & U ! a c & U ! d a F d & U ! h U h U ! h c & U ! c U c U ! c a U ! a U a U ! a d

Utterance: visit h a b c and d in that exact order once you leave any location you can not return to it
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! h U h U ! h a & U ! a U a U ! a b & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c d

Utterance: go to h but do not go to h until you go to b first
LTL: & U ! h b F h

Utterance: make sure you frequent b infinitely
LTL: G F b

Utterance: reach h without going to c then go to c without passing a then go to a without passing d finally go to d
LTL: & U ! c h & U ! a c & U ! d a F d

Utterance: go to h c a d and b in that specific order
LTL: & U ! c h & U ! a c & U ! d a & U ! b d F b

Utterance: go to h b and a an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F h & G F a G F b

Utterance: keep going to h a b and c in any order
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: keep going to h a b c and d in any order
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F b & G F c G F d

Utterance: keep visiting b and h an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F b G F h

Utterance: you can not go to b
LTL: G ! b

Utterance: you can not go to b or h
LTL: & G ! b G ! h

Utterance: always keep away from h a and b
LTL: & G ! h & G ! a G ! b

Utterance: always keep away from h a b and c
LTL: & G ! h & G ! a & G ! b G ! c

Utterance: always keep away from h a b c and d
LTL: & G ! h & G ! a & G ! b & G ! c G ! d

Utterance: you can only go to b after h is seen
LTL: U ! b h

Utterance: do not visit b any more than once
LTL: ! F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: do not visit b any more than two times
LTL: ! F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: do not go to b any more than three times
LTL: ! F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: visit b on at most four separate occasions
LTL: ! F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: do not visit b any more than five times
LTL: ! F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: the minimum number of visits to b is once
LTL: F b

Utterance: reach b on at least two separate occasions
LTL: F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: you have to visit b at least three times
LTL: F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: make sure you go to b at least four separate times
LTL: F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: you can not complete the task without visiting b on five separate occasions
LTL: F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: reach b exactly once
LTL: M b | ! b G | b G ! b

Utterance: go to b exactly twice
LTL: M & b F & ! b F b | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G ! b

Utterance: make sure that you have exactly three separate visits to b
LTL: M & b F & ! b F & b F & ! b F b | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G ! b

Utterance: complete exactly four distinct visits to b
LTL: M & b F & ! b F & b F & ! b F & b F & ! b F b | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G ! b

Utterance: do not go to b any more or any fewer than five different times
LTL: M & b F & ! b F & b F & ! b F & b F & ! b F & b F & ! b F b | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G ! b

Utterance: whenever you observe b this locks h from becoming true from the next instance
LTL: G i b X G ! h

Utterance: always once you observe b ensure that you go to h at least once in the future
LTL: G i b F h

Utterance: proceed to reach h at the next time instant only and only if you see b
LTL: G e b X h

Utterance: wait at b till you see h
LTL: U b h

Utterance: go to h in the very next time instant whenever you see b
LTL: G i b X h
