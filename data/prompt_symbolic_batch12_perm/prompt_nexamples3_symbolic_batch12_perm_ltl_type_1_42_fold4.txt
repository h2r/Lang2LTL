Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: reach d
LTL: F d

Utterance: reach b
LTL: F b

Utterance: visit a
LTL: F a

Utterance: go to d and c in any order
LTL: & F d F c

Utterance: visit c and b
LTL: & F b F c

Utterance: go to a and go to c
LTL: & F a F c

Utterance: you must go to c h and a at least once
LTL: & F h & F a F c

Utterance: head to h a and b in any order
LTL: & F h & F a F b

Utterance: go to h b and a
LTL: & F h & F b F a

Utterance: visit h go to a reach c reach d
LTL: & F h & F a & F c F d

Utterance: go to h a b and c in arbitrary order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: visit b h a and c
LTL: & F h & F b & F a F c

Utterance: make sure you go to h a c d b in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F c & F d F b

Utterance: go to h a b c and d
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: visit h b a c and d
LTL: & F h & F b & F a & F c F d

Utterance: find d first then find c
LTL: F & d F c

Utterance: visit b and then c
LTL: F & b F c

Utterance: go to c after going to a
LTL: F & a F c

Utterance: go to h then go to a then go to c
LTL: F & h F & a F c

Utterance: visit h a and b one after another
LTL: F & h F & a F b

Utterance: visit h sometime afterwards visit b sometime afterwards visit a
LTL: F & h F & b F a

Utterance: first go to h then visit a then move to c finally reach d
LTL: F & h F & a F & c F d

Utterance: visit h a b and c in this order there can be other locations in between
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F c

Utterance: eventually in some sequence visit h b a and c each must be followed by the next
LTL: F & h F & b F & a F c

Utterance: visit h then a then c then d and finally b
LTL: F & h F & a F & c F & d F b

Utterance: reach h a b c and d sequentially
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: visit h b a c and d in this order there can be other landmarks in between
LTL: F & h F & b F & a F & c F d

Utterance: first go to h while staying away from a then go to a while staying away from c finally visit c
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! c a F c

Utterance: go to h only then go to a and only then go to b
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! b a F b

Utterance: do not visit a until visiting b do not visit b until visiting h
LTL: & U ! b h & U ! a b F a

Utterance: go to d and then go to c but do not visit c before d is visited
LTL: & U ! c d F c

Utterance: find c but not until you find b first
LTL: & U ! c b F c

Utterance: visit c but do not visit c before you reach a
LTL: & U ! c a F c

Utterance: please visit d infinitely often
LTL: G F d

Utterance: go to b an infinite number of times
LTL: G F b

Utterance: visit a infinitely often
LTL: G F a

Utterance: first go directly to h without visiting any other waypoints then go directly to a then directly to b and finally directly to c
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: visit h b a and c in that specific order make sure not to visit waypoints out of turn
LTL: & U ! b h & U ! a b & U ! c a F c

Utterance: go to a but do not go to a until d is visited and do not go to d until h is visited and do not go to h until b is visited
LTL: & U ! h b & U ! d h & U ! a d F a

Utterance: visit h a b c and d in this order without skipping any one of them
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: go to h but not through b a c or d and then go to b but not through a c or d and then go to a but not through c or d and then go to c but not through d and finally go to d
LTL: & U ! b h & U ! a b & U ! c a & U ! d c F d

Utterance: visit b h d a and c in that specific order ensure to not visit locations out of turn
LTL: & U ! h b & U ! d h & U ! a d & U ! c a F c

Utterance: travel to a c and h infinitely
LTL: & G F h & G F a G F c

Utterance: make sure h a and b are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F h & G F a G F b

Utterance: never stop visiting h b and a
LTL: & G F h & G F b G F a

Utterance: keep visiting h a c and d an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F c G F d

Utterance: make sure h a b and c are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: never stop visiting h b a and c
LTL: & G F h & G F b & G F a G F c

Utterance: keep visiting h a c d and b an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F c & G F d G F b

Utterance: make sure h a b c and d are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F b & G F c G F d

Utterance: never stop visiting h b a c and d
LTL: & G F h & G F b & G F a & G F c G F d

Utterance: make sure b and h are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F b G F h

Utterance: repeatedly visit h and b forever
LTL: & G F h G F b

Utterance: keep visiting d and a forever
LTL: & G F d G F a
