Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: head to b
LTL: F b

Utterance: go to b and h in any order
LTL: & F b F h

Utterance: move to h a and b in any order
LTL: & F h & F a F b

Utterance: stop by h a b and c in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: go to h a b c and d in arbitrary order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: go to b and then to h
LTL: F & b F h

Utterance: reach h then reach a then reach b
LTL: F & h F & a F b

Utterance: travel from h to c to a to d and make sure to go to c after h a after c and d after a
LTL: F & h F & c F & a F d

Utterance: make sure h a b c and d are all visited in this order there can be other locations in between
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: go to c after you have visited h and go to a after you have visited c
LTL: & U ! c h & U ! a c F a

Utterance: you must go to b while avoiding h and then go to h only go to b one time before visiting h
LTL: & & U ! h b F h U ! b U b U ! b h

Utterance: go to h but not through c or a and then go to c but not through a and finally go to a no revisiting is allowed
LTL: & & U ! c h & U ! a c F a & U ! h U h U ! h c U ! c U c U ! c a

Utterance: go to h but not through c a or d and then go to c but not through a or d and then go to a but not through d and finally go to d no revisiting is allowed

Utterance: visit h only once then eventually visit a only once then visit b in the future for one time followed by one visit to c and after that d
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! h U h U ! h a & U ! a U a U ! a b & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c d

Utterance: go to b then h you can not visit h before b
LTL: & U ! h b F h

Utterance: patrol b repeatedly
LTL: G F b

Utterance: visit h before visiting c a and d then visit c before visiting a d and then visit a before visiting d finally reach d
LTL: & U ! c h & U ! a c & U ! d a F d

Utterance: make your way to b only after going to d before that make your way to d only after going to a before that make your way to a only after going to c before that make your way to c only after going to h
LTL: & U ! c h & U ! a c & U ! d a & U ! b d F b

Utterance: repeatedly keep visiting h a and b
LTL: & G F h & G F a G F b

Utterance: continue to stop at h a b and c
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: cycle through c d a b and h
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F b & G F c G F d

Utterance: keep going to b and h in arbitrary order
LTL: & G F b G F h

Utterance: you must never go to b
LTL: G ! b

Utterance: avoid reaching b and h
LTL: & G ! b G ! h

Utterance: ensure that you never reach the locations h a and b
LTL: & G ! h & G ! a G ! b

Utterance: avoid going to h a b and c
LTL: & G ! h & G ! a & G ! b G ! c

Utterance: make sure you never reach the following locations h a b c and d
LTL: & G ! h & G ! a & G ! b & G ! c G ! d

Utterance: you can only go to b after h is seen
LTL: U ! b h

Utterance: you can not visit b more than once
LTL: ! F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: you can not visit b more than twice
LTL: ! F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: you can not visit b more than three times
LTL: ! F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: you can not visit b more than four times

Utterance: you can not visit b more than five times
LTL: ! F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: visit b equal or more than once
LTL: F b

Utterance: visit b equal or more than twice

Utterance: make sure to not visit b any fewer than three times
LTL: F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: visit b equal or more than four times
LTL: F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b
