Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: visit b
LTL: F b

Utterance: walk to h
LTL: F h

Utterance: reach b and h in any order
LTL: & F b F h

Utterance: go to one of h and b and then to the other
LTL: & F h F b

Utterance: visit h a and b in any order
LTL: & F h & F a F b

Utterance: go to the following locations h b and a
LTL: & F h & F b F a

Utterance: visit h go to a reach b reach c
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: stop by h b a and c in any order
LTL: & F h & F b & F a F c

Utterance: make sure you go to h a b c d in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: go to h b a c and d in arbitrary order
LTL: & F h & F b & F a & F c F d

Utterance: go to b then move to h
LTL: F & b F h

Utterance: go to h and then go to b
LTL: F & h F b

Utterance: make your way to h a and b consecutively
LTL: F & h F & a F b

Utterance: visit h then visit b then reach a
LTL: F & h F & b F a

Utterance: visit c at least once after visiting h visit a at least once after visiting h and c visit d at least once after visiting h c and a
LTL: F & h F & c F & a F d

Utterance: travel from h to c to a to b
LTL: F & h F & c F & a F b

Utterance: visit h then a then b then c and finally d
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: make sure h b a c and d are all visited in this order there can be other locations in between
LTL: F & h F & b F & a F & c F d

Utterance: visit h at least once then visit c at least once finally visit a do not visit c or a before h do not visit a before c
LTL: & U ! c h & U ! a c F a

Utterance: first go to h then go to c only after h finally go to a only after c
LTL: & U ! c h & U ! a c F a

Utterance: reach b and then h in that exact order without repetitions
LTL: & & U ! h b F h U ! b U b U ! b h

Utterance: go to h exactly once while avoiding b then go to b
LTL: & & U ! b h F b U ! h U h U ! h b

Utterance: go to h exactly once then go to c exactly once finally go to a do not go to c or a before h do not go to a before c
LTL: & & U ! c h & U ! a c F a & U ! h U h U ! h c U ! c U c U ! c a

Utterance: visit h exactly once do not visit c or a before h then visit c exactly once do not visit a before c finally visit a
LTL: & & U ! c h & U ! a c F a & U ! h U h U ! h c U ! c U c U ! c a

Utterance: visit c but before visiting c you must visit h only after that visit a after visiting a visit d visit each location once
LTL: & & U ! c h & U ! a c & U ! d a F d & U ! h U h U ! h c & U ! c U c U ! c a U ! a U a U ! a d

Utterance: visit each of h c a and b exactly once in this order
LTL: & & U ! c h & U ! a c & U ! b a F b & U ! h U h U ! h c & U ! c U c U ! c a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: make your way to d only after going to c before that make your way to c only after going to b before that make your way to b only after going to a before that make your way to a only after going to h do not go back to the previous location you have visited while heading to the next
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! h U h U ! h a & U ! a U a U ! a b & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c d

Utterance: go to h only then go to b only then go to a only then go to c and only then go to d make sure to not revisit any of the locations before completing the task
LTL: & & U ! b h & U ! a b & U ! c a & U ! d c F d & U ! h U h U ! h b & U ! b U b U ! b a & U ! a U a U ! a c U ! c U c U ! c d

Utterance: visit h only after visiting b
LTL: & U ! h b F h
