Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: go to b
LTL: F b

Utterance: make sure you visit d at least once
LTL: F d

Utterance: go to b and c in any order
LTL: & F c F b

Utterance: pick one from d and b go there and then head to the other one
LTL: & F d F b

Utterance: please visit b c and d in any order
LTL: & F b & F c F d

Utterance: walk to c a and b in an arbitrary order
LTL: & F c & F a F b

Utterance: visit d go to b reach c reach a
LTL: & F d & F b & F c F a

Utterance: please visit each of h d b and c
LTL: & F c & F b & F d F h

Utterance: make sure you go to d b c a h in any order
LTL: & F d & F b & F c & F a F h

Utterance: go to b c a d and h
LTL: & F c & F b & F d & F h F a

Utterance: visit c then visit b
LTL: F & c F b

Utterance: go to d and move on to b once you have been to d
LTL: F & d F b

Utterance: go to d after c go to c after going to b
LTL: F & b F & c F d

Utterance: head to c a and b in order
LTL: F & c F & a F b

Utterance: go to h then go to a then go to d and then go to c
LTL: F & h F & a F & d F c

Utterance: travel to c then travel to h then go to b then reach a
LTL: F & c F & h F & b F a

Utterance: visit d then b then c then a and finally h
LTL: F & d F & b F & c F & a F h

Utterance: visit c followed by b then b followed by d then d followed by h then h followed by a and then a
LTL: F & c F & b F & d F & h F a

Utterance: reach d but not until you visit c and h and that specific order
LTL: & U ! h c & U ! d h F d

Utterance: move to h while avoiding a and b then move to a while avoiding b finally reach b
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! b a F b

Utterance: visit h but only after c also you can not revisit c before completing the remaining tasks
LTL: & & U ! h c F h U ! c U c U ! c h

Utterance: go to h only then go to c but ensure to not revisit h
LTL: & & U ! c h F c U ! h U h U ! h c

Utterance: go to a but do not visit b or c and then go to b but do not visit c or revisit a and then go to c but do not revisit a or b
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U ! a b U ! b U b U ! b c

Utterance: reach h first only then reach b and do not visit h again only then reach c and do not visit b again
LTL: & & U ! b h & U ! c b F c & U ! h U h U ! h b U ! b U b U ! b c

Utterance: visit b then d then c then a follow this strict order and visit each location only once
LTL: & & U ! d b & U ! c d & U ! a c F a & U ! b U b U ! b d & U ! d U d U ! d c U ! c U c U ! c a

Utterance: visit d one time but not through a b or h and then visit a once but not through d b or h and then visit b once but not through d a or h and then visit h once but not through d a or b
LTL: & & U ! a d & U ! b a & U ! h b F h & U ! d U d U ! d a & U ! a U a U ! a b U ! b U b U ! b h

Utterance: visit h only once then eventually visit c only once then visit a in the future for one time followed by one visit to b and after that d
LTL: & & U ! c h & U ! a c & U ! b a & U ! d b F d & U ! h U h U ! h c & U ! c U c U ! c a & U ! a U a U ! a b U ! b U b U ! b d

Utterance: visit b c d h and a once do not visit c without visiting b and do not visit d without visiting c also do not visit h without visiting d and do not visit a without visiting h
LTL: & & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d & U ! a h F a & U ! b U b U ! b c & U ! c U c U ! c d & U ! d U d U ! d h U ! h U h U ! h a

Utterance: go to c but keep avoiding a and once you have been to c go to a
LTL: & U ! a c F a

Utterance: go to c but do not go to c until you go to h first
LTL: & U ! c h F c

Utterance: visit h infinitely often
LTL: G F h

Utterance: never stop visiting a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: first go to h while avoiding b then go to b while staying away from c then go to c while staying away from d then visit d
LTL: & U ! b h & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: visit c h b and a in this strict order once the predecessor is visited you must visit the successor
LTL: & U ! h c & U ! b h & U ! a b F a

Utterance: visit b then d then c then a then h while ensuring not to visit d before b not to visit c before d not to visit a before c not to visit h before a
LTL: & U ! d b & U ! c d & U ! a c & U ! h a F h

Utterance: ensure that you visit c but only after h in turn only visit h after b only visit b after a and only visit a after d
LTL: & U ! a d & U ! b a & U ! h b & U ! c h F c

Utterance: keep going to d b and a an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F d & G F b G F a

Utterance: never stop visiting h b and c
LTL: & G F h & G F b G F c

Utterance: keep visiting d b c and a an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F d & G F b & G F c G F a

Utterance: keep visiting c b d and h in any order infinitely
LTL: & G F c & G F b & G F d G F h

Utterance: keep visiting d b c a and h an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F d & G F b & G F c & G F a G F h

Utterance: keep visiting c b d h and a in any order infinitely
LTL: & G F c & G F b & G F d & G F h G F a

Utterance: do not stop visiting a and h
LTL: & G F a G F h

Utterance: keep going to c and b in arbitrary order
LTL: & G F c G F b
