Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: go to c
LTL: F c

Utterance: go to h
LTL: F h

Utterance: go to c and b
LTL: & F c F b

Utterance: sometime along the way go to h and b
LTL: & F h F b

Utterance: head to b c and a in any order
LTL: & F b & F c F a

Utterance: visit b h and c in any order
LTL: & F b & F h F c

Utterance: make your way to c a d and b
LTL: & F c & F a & F d F b

Utterance: visit h c b and d
LTL: & F c & F h & F b F d

Utterance: reach the following five locations c a d b h
LTL: & F c & F a & F d & F b F h

Utterance: visit c h b d and a
LTL: & F c & F h & F b & F d F a

Utterance: go to c then b
LTL: F & c F b

Utterance: go to h and sometime afterward visit b
LTL: F & h F b

Utterance: visit b c and a one after another
LTL: F & b F & c F a

Utterance: make your way to b h and c consecutively
LTL: F & b F & h F c

Utterance: travel from a to b to h to c
LTL: F & a F & b F & h F c

Utterance: you have to walk to b and then walk to d and then walk to a and finally walk to c
LTL: F & b F & d F & a F c

Utterance: visit c a d b and h in this order there can be other locations in between
LTL: F & c F & a F & d F & b F h

Utterance: visit c h b d and a in this order there can be other landmarks in between
LTL: F & c F & h F & b F & d F a

Utterance: first go to h then go to b only after h finally go to c only after b
LTL: & U ! b h & U ! c b F c

Utterance: reach d but not until you visit b and c and that specific order
LTL: & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: go to d exactly once while avoiding c then go to c
LTL: & & U ! c d F c U ! d U d U ! d c

Utterance: reach h and then c in that exact order without repetitions
LTL: & & U ! c h F c U ! h U h U ! h c

Utterance: go to d but do not visit b or h and then go to b but do not visit h or revisit d and then go to h but do not revisit d or b
LTL: & & U ! b d & U ! h b F h & U ! d U d U ! d b U ! b U b U ! b h

Utterance: go to b but do not visit d or c and then go to d but do not visit c or revisit b and then go to c but do not revisit b or d
LTL: & & U ! d b & U ! c d F c & U ! b U b U ! b d U ! d U d U ! d c

Utterance: first go to a once then go to c once while avoiding b then go to b once while avoiding h finally go to h
LTL: & & U ! c a & U ! b c & U ! h b F h & U ! a U a U ! a c & U ! c U c U ! c b U ! b U b U ! b h

Utterance: visit b then d then a and then h in that strict order without returning to previously visited locations
LTL: & & U ! d b & U ! a d & U ! h a F h & U ! b U b U ! b d & U ! d U d U ! d a U ! a U a U ! a h

Utterance: go from h to a to b to c to d in that specific order and only visit each landmark one time
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! h U h U ! h a & U ! a U a U ! a b & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c d

Utterance: first visit d while avoiding b then visit b while avoiding c then visit c while avoiding a then visit a while avoiding h finally visit h visit each location once
LTL: & & U ! b d & U ! c b & U ! a c & U ! h a F h & U ! d U d U ! d b & U ! b U b U ! b c & U ! c U c U ! c a U ! a U a U ! a h

Utterance: head to c first and then to d but do not visit d if you have not been to c
LTL: & U ! d c F d

Utterance: go to b and only then go to a
LTL: & U ! a b F a

Utterance: never stop visiting b
LTL: G F b

Utterance: continue moving to a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: reach h without going to b then go to b without passing a then go to a without passing d finally go to d
LTL: & U ! b h & U ! a b & U ! d a F d

Utterance: visit d a h and c in this strict order once the predecessor is visited you must visit the successor
LTL: & U ! a d & U ! h a & U ! c h F c

Utterance: visit a then c then b finally h you can not visit c before a you can not visit b before c you can not visit h before b you can not visit d before h
LTL: & U ! c a & U ! b c & U ! h b & U ! d h F d

Utterance: visit b only after b is visited go to d only after d is visited go to a only after a is visited go to h only after h is visited go to c
LTL: & U ! d b & U ! a d & U ! h a & U ! c h F c

Utterance: never stop visiting c d and a
LTL: & G F c & G F d G F a

Utterance: repeatedly keep visiting h a and c
LTL: & G F h & G F a G F c

Utterance: keep going to c a d and b
LTL: & G F c & G F a & G F d G F b

Utterance: never stop visiting c h b and d
LTL: & G F c & G F h & G F b G F d

Utterance: go to c b d h and a an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F c & G F a & G F d & G F b G F h

Utterance: never stop visiting c h b d and a
LTL: & G F c & G F h & G F b & G F d G F a

Utterance: always keep visiting c and a
LTL: & G F c G F a

Utterance: keep visiting b and h forever
LTL: & G F b G F h
