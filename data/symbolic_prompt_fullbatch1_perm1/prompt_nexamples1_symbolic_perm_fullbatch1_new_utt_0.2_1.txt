Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: reach d
LTL: F d

Utterance: visit a and d
LTL: & F a F d

Utterance: go to a c and d in any order
LTL: & F a & F c F d

Utterance: go to d c b and h in arbitrary order
LTL: & F d & F c & F b F h

Utterance: go to d c b h and a
LTL: & F d & F c & F b & F h F a

Utterance: eventually first visit a and then d after
LTL: F & a F d

Utterance: go to a then c then d
LTL: F & a F & c F d

Utterance: visit h d b and a one after the other
LTL: F & h F & d F & b F a

Utterance: reach d c b h and a sequentially
LTL: F & d F & c F & b F & h F a

Utterance: go to c only then go to h and only then go to d
LTL: & U ! h c & U ! d h F d

Utterance: go to b only once but keep away from d and then visit d but keep away from b
LTL: & & U ! d b F d U ! b U b U ! b d

Utterance: visit d exactly once do not visit c or b before d then visit c exactly once do not visit b before c finally visit b
LTL: & & U ! c d & U ! b c F b & U ! d U d U ! d c U ! c U c U ! c b

Utterance: visit d but before visiting d you must visit c only after that visit a after visiting a visit b visit each location once
LTL: & & U ! d c & U ! a d & U ! b a F b & U ! c U c U ! c d & U ! d U d U ! d a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: go to a but only after going to d only once go to d only after going to b only once go to b only after going to h only once and go to h only after going to c only once
LTL: & & U ! h c & U ! b h & U ! d b & U ! a d F a & U ! c U c U ! c h & U ! h U h U ! h b & U ! b U b U ! b d U ! d U d U ! d a

Utterance: visit h and visit a only if h is visited
LTL: & U ! a h F a

Utterance: frequent d infinitely
LTL: G F d

Utterance: visit c d h and a in this order without skipping any one of them
LTL: & U ! d c & U ! h d & U ! a h F a

Utterance: visit c before visiting d a b and h then visit d before visiting a b and h then visit a before visiting b and h then visit b before visiting h finally visit h
LTL: & U ! d c & U ! a d & U ! b a & U ! h b F h

Utterance: travel to b d and h infinitely
LTL: & G F h & G F b G F d

Utterance: make sure d c b and h are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F d & G F c & G F b G F h

Utterance: make sure d c b h and a are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F d & G F c & G F b & G F h G F a

Utterance: keep visiting a and h forever
LTL: & G F a G F h

Utterance:
