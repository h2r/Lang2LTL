Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: reach b
LTL: F b

Utterance: visit d
LTL: F d

Utterance: move to b
LTL: F b

Utterance: visit a and c in any order
LTL: & F a F c

Utterance: reach d and c in any order
LTL: & F d F c

Utterance: visit c and h
LTL: & F c F h

Utterance: you must go to d c and b at least once
LTL: & F c & F b F d

Utterance: go to h c and b in any order
LTL: & F h & F c F b

Utterance: visit all three locations b c and d
LTL: & F b & F c F d

Utterance: move to c a d and b in any order
LTL: & F c & F a & F d F b

Utterance: visit h c a and d in no particular order
LTL: & F h & F c & F a F d

Utterance: move to b a c and d in any order
LTL: & F b & F a & F c F d

Utterance: find the following c a d b h
LTL: & F c & F a & F d & F b F h

Utterance: you must visit h c a d b but it can be done in any order
LTL: & F h & F c & F a & F d F b

Utterance: find the following b a c d h
LTL: & F b & F a & F c & F d F h

Utterance: after you have been to a make your way to c
LTL: F & a F c

Utterance: go to d then move to c
LTL: F & d F c

Utterance: visit c visit h after that
LTL: F & c F h

Utterance: go to c then go to b then go to d
LTL: F & c F & b F d

Utterance: go to h then c then b
LTL: F & h F & c F b

Utterance: go to b then visit c then reach d
LTL: F & b F & c F d

Utterance: first go to b then visit c then move to d finally reach h
LTL: F & b F & c F & d F h

Utterance: eventually in some sequence visit b d h and a each must be followed by the next
LTL: F & b F & d F & h F a

Utterance: go to d then go to h then go to a then go to c
LTL: F & d F & h F & a F c

Utterance: head to c and then to a after c is visited and then to d after a is visited and then to b after d is visited and then to h after b is visited
LTL: F & c F & a F & d F & b F h

Utterance: visit h visit c after h then visit a after c then visit d after a finally visit b after d
LTL: F & h F & c F & a F & d F b

Utterance: head to b and then to a after b is visited and then to c after a is visited and then to d after c is visited and then to h after d is visited
LTL: F & b F & a F & c F & d F h

Utterance: go to c only then go to h and only then go to b
LTL: & U ! h c & U ! b h F b

Utterance: visit a at least once then visit b at least once finally visit d do not visit b or d before a do not visit d before b
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! d b F d

Utterance: move to d while avoiding c and a then move to c while avoiding a finally reach a
LTL: & U ! c d & U ! a c F a

Utterance: you must visit b exactly once while avoiding c then you can navigate to c
LTL: & & U ! c b F c U ! b U b U ! b c

Utterance: go to a exactly once while avoiding b then go to b
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: visit b but only after h also you can not revisit h before completing the remaining tasks
LTL: & & U ! b h F b U ! h U h U ! h b

Utterance: go to a exactly once then go to b exactly once finally go to c do not go to b or c before a do not go to c before b
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U ! a b U ! b U b U ! b c

Utterance: go to a first go to d second and do not visit a again go to b third and do not visit d again
LTL: & & U ! d a & U ! b d F b & U ! a U a U ! a d U ! d U d U ! d b

Utterance: first go to c once then go to d once while avoiding a finally go to a
LTL: & & U ! d c & U ! a d F a & U ! c U c U ! c d U ! d U d U ! d a

Utterance: visit h then d then b and then a you can only visit each landmark once
LTL: & & U ! d h & U ! b d & U ! a b F a & U ! h U h U ! h d & U ! d U d U ! d b U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: go to b without visiting c then go to c without visiting a then go to a without visiting d finally go to d while only visiting each location once
LTL: & & U ! c b & U ! a c & U ! d a F d & U ! b U b U ! b c & U ! c U c U ! c a U ! a U a U ! a d

Utterance: first go to h once then go to b once while avoiding c then go to c once while avoiding d finally go to d
LTL: & & U ! b h & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! h U h U ! h b & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c d

Utterance: visit c followed by visiting h then visit d a and b in this exact order visit all locations once
LTL: & & U ! h c & U ! d h & U ! a d & U ! b a F b & U ! c U c U ! c h & U ! h U h U ! h d & U ! d U d U ! d a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: don not stop visiting a h and c
LTL: & & U ! h a & U ! c h & U ! b c & U ! d b F d & U ! a U a U ! a h & U ! h U h U ! h c & U ! c U c U ! c b U ! b U b U ! b d

Utterance: go to c only then go to d without returning only after that go to b without returning only after that go to a without returning and finally only then go to h without returning
