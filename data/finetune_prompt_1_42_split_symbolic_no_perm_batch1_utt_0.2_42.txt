Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: go to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: eventually reach a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: visit a b and c in any order
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: make your way to a b c and d
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: visit all locations a b c d h
LTL: & F a & F b & F c & F d F h

Utterance: go to a then move to b
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: go to a then go to b then go to c
LTL: F & a F & b F c

Utterance: reach a then reach b then reach c and then reach d
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: visit a then visit b then visit c then visit d and then visit h
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F & d F h

Utterance: visit b only after visiting a
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: keep away from b and c while heading to a and then keep away from c while heading to b and eventually go to c
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: go to a only after that go to b only then go to c and only then go to d
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: ensure that you visit h but only after d in turn only visit d after c only visit c after b and only visit b after a
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h

Utterance: move to a exactly once while avoiding b then find b
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: go to a but do not visit b or c and then go to b but do not visit c or revisit a and then go to c but do not revisit a or b
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U !a b U ! b U b U !b c

Utterance: go to a but do not visit b c or d and then go to b but do not visit c or d or revisit a and then go to c but do not visit d or revisit a or b and then go to d but do not revisit a b or c
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c U ! c U c U !c d

Utterance: go to a but do not visit b c d or h and then go to b but do not visit c d or h or revisit a and then go to c but do not visit d or h or revisit a or b and then go to d but do not visit h or revisit a b or c and then go to h but do not revisit a b c or d
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c & U ! c U c U !c d U ! d U d U !d h

Utterance: never stop visiting a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: keep visiting a and b in any order
LTL: & G F a G F b

Utterance: keep visiting a b and c in any order
LTL: & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: keep visiting a b c and d in any order
LTL: & G F a & G F b & G F c G F d

Utterance: keep visiting a b c d h in any order
LTL: & G F a & G F b & G F c & G F d G F h
