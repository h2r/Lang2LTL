Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: reach d
LTL: F d

Utterance: reach b
LTL: F b

Utterance: go to d and c in any order
LTL: & F d F c

Utterance: visit c and b
LTL: & F b F c

Utterance: visit h go to a reach c reach d
LTL: & F h & F a & F c F d

Utterance: go to h a b and c in arbitrary order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: make sure you go to h a c d b in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F c & F d F b

Utterance: go to h a b c and d
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: find d first then find c
LTL: F & d F c

Utterance: visit b and then c
LTL: F & b F c

Utterance: go to h then go to a then go to c
LTL: F & h F & a F c

Utterance: visit h a and b one after another
LTL: F & h F & a F b

Utterance: first go to h then visit a then move to c finally reach d
LTL: F & h F & a F & c F d

Utterance: visit h a b and c in this order there can be other locations in between
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F c

Utterance: visit h then a then c then d and finally b
LTL: F & h F & a F & c F & d F b

Utterance: reach h a b c and d sequentially
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: visit h but before visiting h you must visit b visit each location once
LTL: & & U ! h b F h U ! b U b U ! b h

Utterance: reach h exactly once while staying away from b then move to b
LTL: & & U ! b h F b U ! h U h U ! h b

Utterance: do not go to b until a is visited and do not go to a until h is visited along the path never return to previous location you have been to
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! b a F b & U ! h U h U ! h a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: do not visit a until you visit b visit b only once do no visit b until you visit h visit h only once
LTL: & & U ! b h & U ! a b F a & U ! h U h U ! h b U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: do not go to c until b is visited and do not go to b until a is visited and do not go to a until h is visited along the path never return to previous location you have been to
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! h U h U ! h a & U ! a U a U ! a b U ! b U b U ! b c

Utterance: do not visit c until you visit a visit a only once do not visit a until you visit b visit b only once do no visit b until you visit h visit h only once
LTL: & & U ! b h & U ! a b & U ! c a F c & U ! h U h U ! h b & U ! b U b U ! b a U ! a U a U ! a c

Utterance: visit h while staying away from a then visit a while staying away from c then visit c while staying away from d then visit d while staying away from b finally reach b without returning to any previously visited locations
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! c a & U ! d c & U ! b d F b & U ! h U h U ! h a & U ! a U a U ! a c & U ! c U c U ! c d U ! d U d U ! d b

Utterance: go to h but not through a b c or d and then go to a but not through b c or d and then go to b but not through c or d and then go to c but not through d and finally go to d no revisiting is allowed here
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! h U h U ! h a & U ! a U a U ! a b & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c d

Utterance: go to d and then go to c but do not visit c before d is visited
LTL: & U ! c d F c

Utterance: find c but not until you find b first
LTL: & U ! c b F c

Utterance: please visit d infinitely often
LTL: G F d

Utterance: go to b an infinite number of times
LTL: G F b

Utterance: visit h a b c and d in this order without skipping any one of them
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: go to h but not through b a c or d and then go to b but not through a c or d and then go to a but not through c or d and then go to c but not through d and finally go to d
LTL: & U ! b h & U ! a b & U ! c a & U ! d c F d

Utterance: keep visiting h a c and d an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F c G F d

Utterance: make sure h a b and c are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: keep visiting h a c d and b an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F c & G F d G F b

Utterance: make sure h a b c and d are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F b & G F c G F d
