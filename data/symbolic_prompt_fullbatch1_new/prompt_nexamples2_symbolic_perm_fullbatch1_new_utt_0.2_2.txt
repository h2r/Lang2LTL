Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: visit h
LTL: F h

Utterance: stop at h
LTL: F h

Utterance: stop by a and c
LTL: & F a F c

Utterance: visit d and c
LTL: & F d F c

Utterance: go to all of c d and h
LTL: & F c & F d F h

Utterance: go to the following locations c h and a
LTL: & F c & F h F a

Utterance: visit h a b and c in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: stop by d h c and a in any order
LTL: & F d & F h & F c F a

Utterance: do not stop until h a b c and d are all visited
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: go to d h c a and b in arbitrary order
LTL: & F d & F h & F c & F a F b

Utterance: go to c after visiting a
LTL: F & a F c

Utterance: visit d visit c after that
LTL: F & d F c

Utterance: go to c d h make sure to go to d after c and h after d
LTL: F & c F & d F h

Utterance: visit c then visit h then reach a
LTL: F & c F & h F a

Utterance: eventually in some sequence visit h d b and c each must be followed by the next
LTL: F & h F & d F & b F c

Utterance: head to c and then to b after c is visited and then to h after b is visited and then to d after h is visited
LTL: F & c F & b F & h F d

Utterance: visit h then visit a then visit b then visit c finally visit d
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: make sure d h c a and b are all visited in this order there can be other locations in between
LTL: F & d F & h F & c F & a F b

Utterance: in strictly this order visit b then eventually visit d and finally eventually h
LTL: & U ! d b & U ! h d F h

Utterance: in strictly this order visit b then eventually visit c and finally eventually h
LTL: & U ! c b & U ! h c F h

Utterance: visit d one time but not through a and head to a after d is visited but not through d
LTL: & & U ! a d F a U ! d U d U ! d a

Utterance: stay away from a until you visit h exactly once and then go to a while staying away from h
LTL: & & U ! a h F a U ! h U h U ! h a

Utterance: visit b only once without visiting h then visit h one time without visiting a finally visit a in the future
LTL: & & U ! h b & U ! a h F a & U ! b U b U ! b h U ! h U h U ! h a

Utterance: go to b but do not visit h or a and then go to h but do not visit a or revisit b and then go to a but do not revisit b or h
LTL: & & U ! h b & U ! a h F a & U ! b U b U ! b h U ! h U h U ! h a

Utterance: first go to d once then go to a once while avoiding c then go to c once while avoiding b finally go to b
LTL: & & U ! a d & U ! c a & U ! b c F b & U ! d U d U ! d a & U ! a U a U ! a c U ! c U c U ! c b

Utterance: visit c a b and h in this order without skipping any one of them do not revisit any one of them once after you have been there
LTL: & & U ! a c & U ! b a & U ! h b F h & U ! c U c U ! c a & U ! a U a U ! a b U ! b U b U ! b h

Utterance: visit h and only then visit b without returning to h only then visit d without returning to b only then visit c without returning to d and only then visit a without returning to c
LTL: & & U ! b h & U ! d b & U ! c d & U ! a c F a & U ! h U h U ! h b & U ! b U b U ! b d & U ! d U d U ! d c U ! c U c U ! c a

Utterance: do not go to h until d is visited and do not go to d until a is visited and do not go to a until c is visited and do not go to c until b is visited along the path never return to previous location you have been to
LTL: & & U ! c b & U ! a c & U ! d a & U ! h d F h & U ! b U b U ! b c & U ! c U c U ! c a & U ! a U a U ! a d U ! d U d U ! d h

Utterance: go to d but do not go to d until you go to h first
LTL: & U ! d h F d

Utterance: visit h but do not visit h before you reach c
LTL: & U ! h c F h

Utterance: do not stop visiting a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: continue moving to b
LTL: G F b

Utterance: go to b only after that go to h only then go to a and only then go to d
LTL: & U ! h b & U ! a h & U ! d a F d

Utterance: visit a before visiting h d and c then visit h before visiting d c and then visit d before visiting c finally reach c
LTL: & U ! h a & U ! d h & U ! c d F c

Utterance: visit d then a then c finally b you can not visit a before d you can not visit c before a you can not visit b before c you can not visit h before b
LTL: & U ! a d & U ! c a & U ! b c & U ! h b F h

Utterance: visit c do not visit a b h or d until you visit c then visit a do not visit b h or d until you visit a then visit b do not visit h or d until you visit b then visit h do not visit d until you visit h finally reach d
LTL: & U ! a c & U ! b a & U ! h b & U ! d h F d

Utterance: do not stop visiting d c and b
LTL: & G F d & G F c G F b

Utterance: keep visiting d b and a in any order
LTL: & G F d & G F b G F a

Utterance: perpetually travel to a b and h
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: continue to stop at d h c and a
LTL: & G F d & G F h & G F c G F a

Utterance: you are prohibited from not going to c b d a and h forever
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F b & G F c G F d

Utterance: cycle through a b h c and d
LTL: & G F d & G F h & G F c & G F a G F b

Utterance: frequent d and b infinitely in any order
LTL: & G F d G F b

Utterance: always keep visiting d and c
LTL: & G F d G F c

Utterance:
