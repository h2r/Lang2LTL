Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: reach d
LTL: F d

Utterance: make your way to h
LTL: F h

Utterance: visit a and d
LTL: & F a F d

Utterance: go to c and d in any order
LTL: & F d F c

Utterance: go to a c and d in any order
LTL: & F a & F c F d

Utterance: go to c h and a
LTL: & F c & F h F a

Utterance: go to d c b and h in arbitrary order
LTL: & F d & F c & F b F h

Utterance: stop by h d a and c in any order
LTL: & F h & F d & F a F c

Utterance: go to d c b h and a
LTL: & F d & F c & F b & F h F a

Utterance: make your way to h d a c and b
LTL: & F h & F d & F a & F c F b

Utterance: eventually first visit a and then d after
LTL: F & a F d

Utterance: visit d then visit c
LTL: F & d F c

Utterance: go to a then c then d
LTL: F & a F & c F d

Utterance: visit h at least once after going to c and visit a at least once after going to h
LTL: F & c F & h F a

Utterance: visit h d b and a one after the other
LTL: F & h F & d F & b F a

Utterance: visit a then c then d and then h
LTL: F & a F & c F & d F h

Utterance: reach d c b h and a sequentially
LTL: F & d F & c F & b F & h F a

Utterance: move to h then move to d then move to a then move to c finally move to b
LTL: F & h F & d F & a F & c F b

Utterance: go to c only then go to h and only then go to d
LTL: & U ! h c & U ! d h F d

Utterance: visit b at least once then visit c at least once finally visit d do not visit c or d before b do not visit d before c
LTL: & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: go to b only once but keep away from d and then visit d but keep away from b
LTL: & & U ! d b F d U ! b U b U ! b d

Utterance: visit d and a in that exact sequence out of sequence visits and repeated visits are not permitted
LTL: & & U ! a d F a U ! d U d U ! d a

Utterance: visit d exactly once do not visit c or b before d then visit c exactly once do not visit b before c finally visit b
LTL: & & U ! c d & U ! b c F b & U ! d U d U ! d c U ! c U c U ! c b

Utterance: make your way to d only after going to h before that make your way to h only after going to c do not go back to the previous location you have visited while heading to the next
LTL: & & U ! h c & U ! d h F d & U ! c U c U ! c h U ! h U h U ! h d

Utterance: visit d but before visiting d you must visit c only after that visit a after visiting a visit b visit each location once
LTL: & & U ! d c & U ! a d & U ! b a F b & U ! c U c U ! c d & U ! d U d U ! d a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: stay away from d b and h until you make c single visit to c and then make your way to d while staying away from c b and h and then make your way to b while staying away from c d or h and finally make your way to h while staying away from c d and b
LTL: & & U ! d c & U ! b d & U ! h b F h & U ! c U c U ! c d & U ! d U d U ! d b U ! b U b U ! b h

Utterance: go to a but only after going to d only once go to d only after going to b only once go to b only after going to h only once and go to h only after going to c only once
LTL: & & U ! h c & U ! b h & U ! d b & U ! a d F a & U ! c U c U ! c h & U ! h U h U ! h b & U ! b U b U ! b d U ! d U d U ! d a

Utterance: go to c but only after going to b only once go to b only after going to d only once go to d only after going to a only once and go to a only after going to h only once
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! d a & U ! b d & U ! c b F c & U ! h U h U ! h a & U ! a U a U ! a d & U ! d U d U ! d b U ! b U b U ! b c

Utterance: visit h and visit a only if h is visited
LTL: & U ! a h F a

Utterance: do not visit d until you go to c
LTL: & U ! d c F d

Utterance: frequent d infinitely
LTL: G F d

Utterance: make sure you visit d infinite times
LTL: G F d

Utterance: visit c d h and a in this order without skipping any one of them
LTL: & U ! d c & U ! h d & U ! a h F a

Utterance: visit h first while avoiding a then visit a while avoiding d then visit d while avoiding b then visit b
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! d a & U ! b d F b

Utterance: visit c before visiting d a b and h then visit d before visiting a b and h then visit a before visiting b and h then visit b before visiting h finally visit h
LTL: & U ! d c & U ! a d & U ! b a & U ! h b F h

Utterance: visit c d b h and a in that specific order ensure to not visit locations out of turn
LTL: & U ! d c & U ! b d & U ! h b & U ! a h F a

Utterance: travel to b d and h infinitely
LTL: & G F h & G F b G F d

Utterance: do not stop going to d b and a
LTL: & G F b & G F a G F d

Utterance: make sure d c b and h are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F d & G F c & G F b G F h

Utterance: explore d h and a endlessy
LTL: & G F h & G F d & G F a G F c

Utterance: make sure d c b h and a are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F d & G F c & G F b & G F h G F a

Utterance: you can not stop traveling to a h b d and c
LTL: & G F h & G F d & G F a & G F c G F b

Utterance: keep visiting a and h forever
LTL: & G F a G F h
