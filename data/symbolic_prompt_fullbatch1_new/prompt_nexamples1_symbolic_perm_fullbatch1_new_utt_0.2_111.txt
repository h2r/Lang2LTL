Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: go to b
LTL: F b

Utterance: go to b and c in any order
LTL: & F c F b

Utterance: please visit b c and d in any order
LTL: & F b & F c F d

Utterance: visit d go to b reach c reach a
LTL: & F d & F b & F c F a

Utterance: make sure you go to d b c a h in any order
LTL: & F d & F b & F c & F a F h

Utterance: visit c then visit b
LTL: F & c F b

Utterance: go to d after c go to c after going to b
LTL: F & b F & c F d

Utterance: go to h then go to a then go to d and then go to c
LTL: F & h F & a F & d F c

Utterance: visit d then b then c then a and finally h
LTL: F & d F & b F & c F & a F h

Utterance: reach d but not until you visit c and h and that specific order
LTL: & U ! h c & U ! d h F d

Utterance: visit h but only after c also you can not revisit c before completing the remaining tasks
LTL: & & U ! h c F h U ! c U c U ! c h

Utterance: go to a but do not visit b or c and then go to b but do not visit c or revisit a and then go to c but do not revisit a or b
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U ! a b U ! b U b U ! b c

Utterance: visit b then d then c then a follow this strict order and visit each location only once
LTL: & & U ! d b & U ! c d & U ! a c F a & U ! b U b U ! b d & U ! d U d U ! d c U ! c U c U ! c a

Utterance: visit h only once then eventually visit c only once then visit a in the future for one time followed by one visit to b and after that d
LTL: & & U ! c h & U ! a c & U ! b a & U ! d b F d & U ! h U h U ! h c & U ! c U c U ! c a & U ! a U a U ! a b U ! b U b U ! b d

Utterance: go to c but keep avoiding a and once you have been to c go to a
LTL: & U ! a c F a

Utterance: visit h infinitely often
LTL: G F h

Utterance: first go to h while avoiding b then go to b while staying away from c then go to c while staying away from d then visit d
LTL: & U ! b h & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: visit b then d then c then a then h while ensuring not to visit d before b not to visit c before d not to visit a before c not to visit h before a
LTL: & U ! d b & U ! c d & U ! a c & U ! h a F h

Utterance: keep going to d b and a an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F d & G F b G F a

Utterance: keep visiting d b c and a an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F d & G F b & G F c G F a

Utterance: keep visiting d b c a and h an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F d & G F b & G F c & G F a G F h

Utterance: do not stop visiting a and h
LTL: & G F a G F h

Utterance:
