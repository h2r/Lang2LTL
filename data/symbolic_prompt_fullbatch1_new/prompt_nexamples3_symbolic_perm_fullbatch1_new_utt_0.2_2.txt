Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: visit h
LTL: F h

Utterance: stop at h
LTL: F h

Utterance: go to b
LTL: F b

Utterance: stop by a and c
LTL: & F a F c

Utterance: visit d and c
LTL: & F d F c

Utterance: pick one from a and c go there and then head to the other one
LTL: & F a F c

Utterance: go to all of c d and h
LTL: & F c & F d F h

Utterance: go to the following locations c h and a
LTL: & F c & F h F a

Utterance: visit b a and d in any order
LTL: & F b & F a F d

Utterance: visit h a b and c in any order
