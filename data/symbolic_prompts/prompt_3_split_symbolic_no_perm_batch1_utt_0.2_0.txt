LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h

Utterance: visit a b c d and h in that specific order ensure to not visit locations out of turn
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h

Utterance: you must visit a exactly once while avoiding b then you can navigate to b
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: navigate to a exactly once while staying away from b then you can go to b

Utterance: do not go to h until d is visited and do not go to d until c is visited and do not go to c until b is visited and do not go to b until a is visited along the path never return to previous location you have been to
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c & U ! c U c U !c d U ! d U d U !d h

Utterance: visit a then b then c then d and then h visit each landmark only once
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c & U ! c U c U !c d U ! d U d U !d h

Utterance: make your way to h only after going to d before that make your way to d only after going to c before that make your way to c only after going to b before that make your way to b only after going to a do not go back to the previous location you have visited while heading to the next
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c & U ! c U c U !c d U ! d U d U !d h
