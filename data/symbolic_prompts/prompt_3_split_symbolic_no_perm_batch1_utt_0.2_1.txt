Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: eventually you must go to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: reach a
LTL: F a

Utterance: make sure you visit a at least once
LTL: F a

Utterance: sometime along the way go to a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: visit a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: go to a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: eventually reach a c and b
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: go to a b and c
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: move to abc in any order
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: visit a b c and d
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: visit abc and d in any order

Utterance: in no particular order visit a b c and d
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: visit a b c d h in any order required
LTL: & F a & F b & F c & F d F h

LTL: & F a & F b & F c & F d F h

Utterance: eventually go visit a b h d and c
LTL: & F a & F b & F c & F d F h

Utterance: visit a and visit b after a is visited
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: go to a then move to b
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: go to b after going to a

Utterance: head to a b and c in order
LTL: F & a F & b F c

Utterance: visit a then visit b then visit c then visit d
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: make sure a b c and d are all visited in this order
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: you have to walk to a and then walk to b and then walk to c and finally walk to d
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: visit a b c d and h sequentially
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F & d F h

Utterance: make sure a b c d and h are all visited in this order

Utterance: you have to walk to a and then walk to b and then walk to c and then walk to d and finally walk to h
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F & d F h

Utterance: visit b only after visiting a
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: go to a but keep avoiding b and once you have been to a go to b
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: go to a while staying away from b then move to b
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: in strictly this order visit a then eventually visit b and finally eventually c
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: reach c but not until you visit a and b and that specific order
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: visit a only then should you visit b and only after that should you reach c
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: visit a b c and d in that specific order make sure not to visit waypoints out of turn
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: visit a b c and d in this order without skipping any one of them
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: do not go to d until c is visited and do not go to c until b is visited and do not go to b until a is visited
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: go to a b c d and h in that specific order
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h

Utterance: visit a b c d and h in this order without skipping any one of them
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h

Utterance: do not go to h until d is visited and do not go to d until c is visited and do not go to c until b is visited and do not go to b until a is visited
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h

Utterance: visit b but only after a also you cannot revisit a before completing the remaining tasks
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: do not visit b before you visit a and then go to b without revisiting a
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: go to a only once but keep away from b and then visit b
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: visit a exactly once while avoiding b and c then visit b exactly once while avoiding c finally visit c
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U !a b U ! b U b U !b c

Utterance: go to a but do not visit b or c and then go to b but do not visit c or revisit a and then go to c but do not revisit a or b
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U !a b U ! b U b U !b c

Utterance: make your way to h only after going to d before that make your way to d only after going to c before that make your way to c only after going to b before that make your way to b only after going to a do not go back to the previous location you have visited while heading to the next
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c & U ! c U c U !c d U ! d U d U !d h

Utterance: visit a then b then c then d and then h visit each landmark only once
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c & U ! c U c U !c d U ! d U d U !d h

Utterance: go to a but not through b c d or h and then go to b but not through c d or h and then go to c but not through d or h and then go to d but not through h and finally go to h no revisiting is allowed here
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c & U ! c U c U !c d U ! d U d U !d h
