Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: stop by a
LTL: F a

Utterance: move to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: go to a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: eventually reach a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: when you have the chance can you go to a c and b
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: head to a b and c in any order
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: go to a go to b got to c and go to d
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: visit b a c and d
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: visit a b c d and h
LTL: & F a & F b & F c & F d F h

Utterance: sometime visit a c b h and d
LTL: & F a & F b & F c & F d F h

Utterance: move to a then move to b
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: eventually first visit a and then b after
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: visit a b and c one after another
LTL: F & a F & b F c

Utterance: visit a sometime afterwards visit b sometime afterwards visit c
LTL: F & a F & b F c

Utterance: make sure a b c and d are all visited in this order
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: visit a then visit b then visit c then visit d
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: you have to walk to a and then walk to b and then walk to c and then walk to d and finally walk to h
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F & d F h

Utterance: visit a b c d and h sequentially
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F & d F h

Utterance: find b but not until you find a first
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: do not visit b until you go to a
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: reach c but not until you visit a and b and that specific order
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: in strictly this order visit a then eventually visit b and finally eventually c
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: do not go to d until c is visited and do not go to c until b is visited and do not go to b until a is visited
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: visit a b c and d in that specific order make sure not to visit waypoints out of turn
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: do not go to h until d is visited and do not go to d until c is visited and do not go to c until b is visited and do not go to b until a is visited
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h

Utterance: go to a b c d and h in that specific order
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h
