Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: go to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: make sure you visit a at least once
LTL: F a

LTL: F a

Utterance: make sure both a and b are visited
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: go to a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: visit both a and b

Utterance: walk to a b and c in an arbitrary order
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: go to a b and c
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: visit a b c and d in no particular order
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: visit a go to b reach c reach d
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: make sure a b c and d are all visited
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: find the following a b c d h

LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: go to b but only visit b if you already visited a
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: in strictly this order visit a then eventually visit b and finally eventually c

Utterance: go to a but not through b c or d and then go to b but not through c or d and then go to c but not through d and finally go to d
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: before visiting b c d and h visit an and never visit it again then visit b before c d and h and never visit it again do not visit d and h until you visit c never visit c again then visit d before h and never visit h again finally visit h
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h

Utterance: go to h not before going d do not go to d before going c do not go to c before going to b and do not go to before going to a
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h

Utterance: go to a but not through b c d or h and then go to b but not through c d or h and then go to c but not through d or h and then go to d but not through h and finally go to h
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h

Utterance: visit a and b in that exact sequence out of sequence visits and repeated visits are not permitted
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: move to a exactly once while avoiding b then find b
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: avoid b initially when a is not visited and then just visit a once and then visit b
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: make your way to h only after going to d before that make your way to d only after going to c before that make your way to c only after going to b before that make your way to b only after going to a do not go back to the previous location you have visited while heading to the next
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c & U ! c U c U !c d U ! d U d U !d h
