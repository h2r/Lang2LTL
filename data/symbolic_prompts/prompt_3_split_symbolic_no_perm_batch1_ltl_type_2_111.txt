Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: stop by a
LTL: F a

Utterance: move to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: visit a
LTL: F a

Utterance: go to a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: eventually reach a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: visit a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: when you have the chance can you go to a c and b
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: head to a b and c in any order
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: go to a b and c
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: go to a go to b got to c and go to d
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: visit b a c and d
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: go to a b c and d in arbitrary order
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: visit a b c d and h
LTL: & F a & F b & F c & F d F h

Utterance: sometime visit a c b h and d
LTL: & F a & F b & F c & F d F h

Utterance: visit a b c d and h
LTL: & F a & F b & F c & F d F h

Utterance: move to a exactly once while avoiding b then find b
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: only visit a once and do not visit b until you visit a
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: visit b but only after a also you cannot revisit a before completing the remaining tasks
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: go to a but do not visit b or c and then go to b but do not visit c or revisit a and then go to c but do not revisit a or b
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U !a b U ! b U b U !b c

Utterance: do not visit c until you visit b visit b only once do no visit b until you visit a visit a only once
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U !a b U ! b U b U !b c

Utterance: visit a b and c in this order without skipping any one of them do not revisit any one of them once after you have been there
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U !a b U ! b U b U !b c

Utterance: go to a but do not visit b c or d and then go to b but do not visit c or d or revisit a and then go to c but do not visit d or revisit a or b and then go to d but do not revisit a b or c
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c U ! c U c U !c d

Utterance: do not visit d until you visit c visit c only once do not visit c until you visit b visit b only once do no visit b until you visit a visit a only once
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c U ! c U c U !c d

Utterance: visit a b c and d in this order without skipping any one of them do not revisit any one of them once after you have been there
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c U ! c U c U !c d

Utterance: visit a then b then c then d and then h visit each landmark only once
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c & U ! c U c U !c d U ! d U d U !d h

Utterance: do not visit h until you visit d visit d only once do not visit d until you visit c visit c only once do not visit c until you visit b visit b only once do no visit b until you visit a visit a only once
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c & U ! c U c U !c d U ! d U d U !d h

Utterance: make your way to h only after going to d before that make your way to d only after going to c before that make your way to c only after going to b before that make your way to b only after going to a do not go back to the previous location you have visited while heading to the next
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c & U ! c U c U !c d U ! d U d U !d h

Utterance: do not stop visiting a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: keep visiting a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: make sure you visit a infinite times
LTL: G F a

Utterance: make sure a and b are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F a G F b

Utterance: keep visiting a and b in any order
LTL: & G F a G F b

Utterance: pick one from a and b and go there and then go back and forth between a and b with or without stay
LTL: & G F a G F b

Utterance: never stop visiting a b and c
LTL: & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: keep visiting a b and c in any order
LTL: & G F a & G F b G F c
