Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: eventually you must go to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: sometime along the way go to a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: eventually reach a c and b
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: visit a b c and d
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: visit a b c d h in any order required
LTL: & F a & F b & F c & F d F h

Utterance: visit a and visit b after a is visited
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: go to a then go to b then go to c
LTL: F & a F & b F c

Utterance: visit a then visit b then visit c then visit d
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: visit a b c d and h sequentially
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F & d F h

Utterance: visit b only after visiting a
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: in strictly this order visit a then eventually visit b and finally eventually c
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: visit a b c and d in that specific order make sure not to visit waypoints out of turn
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: go to a b c d and h in that specific order
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h

Utterance: visit b but only after a also you cannot revisit a before completing the remaining tasks
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: visit a exactly once while avoiding b and c then visit b exactly once while avoiding c finally visit c
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U !a b U ! b U b U !b c

Utterance: visit a then b then c and then d you can only visit each landmark once
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c U ! c U c U !c d

Utterance: make your way to h only after going to d before that make your way to d only after going to c before that make your way to c only after going to b before that make your way to b only after going to a do not go back to the previous location you have visited while heading to the next
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c & U ! c U c U !c d U ! d U d U !d h

Utterance: never stop visiting a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: pick one from a and b and go there and then go back and forth between a and b with or without stay
LTL: & G F a G F b

Utterance: frequent a b and c infinitely in any order
LTL: & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: frequent a b c and d infinitely in any order
LTL: & G F a & G F b & G F c G F d

Utterance: frequent a b c d and h infinitely in any order
LTL: & G F a & G F b & G F c & G F d G F h
