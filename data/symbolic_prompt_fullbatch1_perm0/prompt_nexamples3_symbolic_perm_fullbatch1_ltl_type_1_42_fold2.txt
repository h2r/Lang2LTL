Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: make your way to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: move to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: visit a
LTL: F a

Utterance: go to a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: eventually reach b and a
LTL: & F b F a

Utterance: visit b and a
LTL: & F b F a

Utterance: in any order you like go to c a and b
LTL: & F c & F a F b

Utterance: visit c a and b in no specific order
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: c a and b must be visited
LTL: & F c & F a F b

Utterance: visit d a b and c
LTL: & F d & F a & F b F c

Utterance: go to four locations a b c and d
LTL: & F a & F b & F d F c

Utterance: move to c d b and a in any order
LTL: & F c & F d & F b F a

Utterance: make sure you go to h a c d b in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F c & F d F b

Utterance: go to h a b c and d
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: visit h b a c and d
LTL: & F h & F b & F a & F c F d

Utterance: go to a then b
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: move to b then move to a
LTL: F & b F a

Utterance: eventually first visit b and then a after
LTL: F & b F a

Utterance: go to c and go to a after c is visited and go to b after c and a are visited
LTL: F & c F & a F b

Utterance: in some sequence visit a b and c in that order
LTL: F & a F & b F c

Utterance: go to c then go to a then go to b
LTL: F & c F & a F b

Utterance: head to d and then to a after d is visited and then to b after a is visited and then to c after b is visited
LTL: F & d F & a F & b F c

Utterance: visit a then visit b then visit d then visit c
LTL: F & a F & b F & d F c

Utterance: visit c d b and a one after the other
LTL: F & c F & d F & b F a

Utterance: visit h then a then c then d and finally b
LTL: F & h F & a F & c F & d F b

Utterance: reach h a b c and d sequentially
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: visit h b a c and d in this order there can be other landmarks in between
LTL: F & h F & b F & a F & c F d

Utterance: visit a first then visit b while only visiting each location once
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: move to b exactly once while avoiding a then find a
LTL: & & U ! a b F a U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: only visit b once and do not visit a until you visit b
LTL: & & U ! a b F a U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: visit b exactly once while avoiding c and a then visit c exactly once while avoiding a finally visit a
LTL: & & U ! c b & U ! a c F a & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c a

Utterance: go to b but not through a or c and then go to a but not through c and finally go to c no revisiting is allowed
LTL: & & U ! a b & U ! c a F c & U ! b U b U ! b a U ! a U a U ! a c

Utterance: do not visit a until you visit c visit c only once do no visit c until you visit b visit b only once
LTL: & & U ! c b & U ! a c F a & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c a

Utterance: visit c only once while avoiding b then visit b once while avoiding d only after visiting d once visit a
LTL: & & U ! b c & U ! d b & U ! a d F a & U ! c U c U ! c b & U ! b U b U ! b d U ! d U d U ! d a

Utterance: go to b but not through c d or a and then go to c but not through d or a and then go to d but not through a and finally go to a no revisiting is allowed
LTL: & & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! a d F a & U ! b U b U ! b c & U ! c U c U ! c d U ! d U d U ! d a

Utterance: do not visit d until you visit b visit b only once do not visit b until you visit a visit a only once do no visit a until you visit c visit c only once
LTL: & & U ! a c & U ! b a & U ! d b F d & U ! c U c U ! c a & U ! a U a U ! a b U ! b U b U ! b d

Utterance: visit h while staying away from a then visit a while staying away from c then visit c while staying away from d then visit d while staying away from b finally reach b without returning to any previously visited locations
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! c a & U ! d c & U ! b d F b & U ! h U h U ! h a & U ! a U a U ! a c & U ! c U c U ! c d U ! d U d U ! d b

Utterance: go to h but not through a b c or d and then go to a but not through b c or d and then go to b but not through c or d and then go to c but not through d and finally go to d no revisiting is allowed here
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! h U h U ! h a & U ! a U a U ! a b & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c d

Utterance: do not visit d until you visit c visit c only once do not visit c until you visit a visit a only once do not visit a until you visit b visit b only once do no visit b until you visit h visit h only once
LTL: & & U ! b h & U ! a b & U ! c a & U ! d c F d & U ! h U h U ! h b & U ! b U b U ! b a & U ! a U a U ! a c U ! c U c U ! c d
