Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: eventually you must go to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: stop at a
LTL: F a

Utterance: move to a and b in any order
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: go to b and a
LTL: & F b F a

Utterance: go to c a and b
LTL: & F c & F a F b

Utterance: visit a c and b in arbitrary order
LTL: & F a & F c F b

Utterance: move to b a c and d in any order
LTL: & F b & F a & F c F d

Utterance: go to c b a and d in any order
LTL: & F a & F c & F d F b

Utterance: go to d c b h and a
LTL: & F d & F c & F b & F h F a

Utterance: make your way to h d a c and b
LTL: & F h & F d & F a & F c F b

Utterance: move a then find b
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: go to b then a
LTL: F & b F a

Utterance: visit a at least once after going to c and visit b at least once after going to a
LTL: F & c F & a F b

Utterance: move to a then move to c then move to b
LTL: F & a F & c F b

Utterance: reach a then reach c then reach d and then reach b
LTL: F & a F & c F & d F b

Utterance: eventually in some sequence visit d c b and a each must be followed by the next
LTL: F & d F & c F & b F a

Utterance: reach d c b h and a sequentially
LTL: F & d F & c F & b F & h F a

Utterance: move to h then move to d then move to a then move to c finally move to b
LTL: F & h F & d F & a F & c F b

Utterance: keep away from a and b while heading to c and then keep away from b while heading to a and eventually go to b
LTL: & U ! a c & U ! b a F b

Utterance: make your way to c but keep avoiding a and b and head to a but keep avoiding b and then visit b
LTL: & U ! a c & U ! b a F b

Utterance: stay away from b until you make a single visit to a and then go to b while staying away from a
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: visit b only once then visit a but do not visit a before visiting b
LTL: & & U ! a b F a U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: reach c first only then reach b and do not visit c again only then reach a and do not visit b again
LTL: & & U ! b c & U ! a b F a & U ! c U c U ! c b U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: reach c first only then reach a and do not visit c again only then reach b and do not visit a again
LTL: & & U ! a c & U ! b a F b & U ! c U c U ! c a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: visit each of d a b and c exactly once in this order
LTL: & & U ! a d & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! d U d U ! d a & U ! a U a U ! a b U ! b U b U ! b c

Utterance: visit c one time but not through d a or b and then visit d once but not through c a or b and then visit a once but not through c d or b and then visit b once but not through c d or a
LTL: & & U ! d c & U ! a d & U ! b a F b & U ! c U c U ! c d & U ! d U d U ! d a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: go to a but only after going to d only once go to d only after going to b only once go to b only after going to h only once and go to h only after going to c only once
LTL: & & U ! h c & U ! b h & U ! d b & U ! a d F a & U ! c U c U ! c h & U ! h U h U ! h b & U ! b U b U ! b d U ! d U d U ! d a

Utterance: go to c but only after going to b only once go to b only after going to d only once go to d only after going to a only once and go to a only after going to h only once
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! d a & U ! b d & U ! c b F c & U ! h U h U ! h a & U ! a U a U ! a d & U ! d U d U ! d b U ! b U b U ! b c

Utterance: visit b then eventually visit a do not visit a before visiting b
LTL: & U ! a b F a

Utterance: visit b then visit a but do not visit a until you visit b
LTL: & U ! a b F a

Utterance: keep going to a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: always stop at a repeatedly
LTL: G F a

Utterance: visit a c d and b in that specific order make sure not to visit waypoints out of turn
LTL: & U ! c a & U ! d c & U ! b d F b

Utterance: visit b before visiting d a and c then visit d before visiting a c and then visit a before visiting c finally reach c
LTL: & U ! d b & U ! a d & U ! c a F c

Utterance: visit c before visiting d a b and h then visit d before visiting a b and h then visit a before visiting b and h then visit b before visiting h finally visit h
LTL: & U ! d c & U ! a d & U ! b a & U ! h b F h

Utterance: visit c d b h and a in that specific order ensure to not visit locations out of turn
LTL: & U ! d c & U ! b d & U ! h b & U ! a h F a

Utterance: never stop visiting a b and c
LTL: & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: please keep visiting a b and c without stopping
LTL: & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: go to b a c and d over and over again
LTL: & G F b & G F a & G F c G F d

Utterance: you are prohibited from not infinitely going to b d a and c
LTL: & G F a & G F c & G F d G F b

Utterance: make sure d c b h and a are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F d & G F c & G F b & G F h G F a

Utterance: you can not stop traveling to a h b d and c
LTL: & G F h & G F d & G F a & G F c G F b

Utterance: visit a and b an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F a G F b

Utterance: do not stop visiting b and a
LTL: & G F b G F a

Utterance:
