Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: stop at a
LTL: F a

Utterance: make sure you visit a at least once
LTL: F a

Utterance: visit a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: reach a and b in any order
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: go to c b and a in any order
LTL: & F c & F b F a

Utterance: c b and a must be visited
LTL: & F c & F b F a

Utterance: visit c a d and b
LTL: & F a & F c & F d F b

Utterance: go to a go to b go to c and go to d
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: find the following c a d b h
LTL: & F c & F a & F d & F b F h

Utterance: you must visit h c a d b but it can be done in any order
LTL: & F h & F c & F a & F d F b

Utterance: eventually first visit a and then b after
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: go to a then move to b
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: go to c then b then a
LTL: F & c F & b F a

Utterance: go to c then go to b then go to a
LTL: F & c F & b F a

Utterance: go to a then go to b then go to d and then go to c
LTL: F & a F & b F & d F c

Utterance: reach a then reach d then reach c and then reach b
LTL: F & a F & d F & c F b

Utterance: head to c and then to a after c is visited and then to d after a is visited and then to b after d is visited and then to h after b is visited
LTL: F & c F & a F & d F & b F h

Utterance: visit h visit c after h then visit a after c then visit d after a finally visit b after d
LTL: F & h F & c F & a F & d F b

Utterance: do not go to b until you visit c and do not go to c until you visit a and make sure you visit b
LTL: & U ! c a & U ! b c F b

Utterance: visit a at least once then visit b at least once finally visit c do not visit b or c before a do not visit c before b
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: go to b without visiting a then go to a without going to b again
LTL: & & U ! a b F a U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: visit b and visit only once then eventually visit a do not visit a before visiting b
LTL: & & U ! a b F a U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: only visit c once followed by visiting b then visiting a once
LTL: & & U ! b c & U ! a b F a & U ! c U c U ! c b U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: first go to b once then go to a once while avoiding c finally go to c
LTL: & & U ! a b & U ! c a F c & U ! b U b U ! b a U ! a U a U ! a c

Utterance: visit c then d then a then b follow this strict order and visit each location only once
LTL: & & U ! d c & U ! a d & U ! b a F b & U ! c U c U ! c d & U ! d U d U ! d a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: go to d only once but keep away from b a and c and then go to b only once but keep away from d a and c and then go to a only once but keep way from d b and c and finally go to c once but keep away from d b and a
LTL: & & U ! b d & U ! a b & U ! c a F c & U ! d U d U ! d b & U ! b U b U ! b a U ! a U a U ! a c

Utterance: visit c followed by visiting h then visit d a and b in this exact order visit all locations once
LTL: & & U ! h c & U ! d h & U ! a d & U ! b a F b & U ! c U c U ! c h & U ! h U h U ! h d & U ! d U d U ! d a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: don not stop visiting a h and c
LTL: & & U ! h a & U ! c h & U ! b c & U ! d b F d & U ! a U a U ! a h & U ! h U h U ! h c & U ! c U c U ! c b U ! b U b U ! b d

Utterance: go from a to b do not go to b before visiting a
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: you must visit b first before going to a
LTL: & U ! a b F a

Utterance: keep visiting a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: always stop at a repeatedly
LTL: G F a

Utterance: go to a only after that go to d only then go to b and only then go to c
LTL: & U ! d a & U ! b d & U ! c b F c

Utterance: first go to b while avoiding a then go to a while staying away from c then go to c while staying away from d then visit d
LTL: & U ! a b & U ! c a & U ! d c F d

Utterance: go to h and only go to d only after h is visited and then go to b only after h and d are both visited and then go to a only after h d and b are all visited and then go to c only after h d b and a are all visited
LTL: & U ! d h & U ! b d & U ! a b & U ! c a F c

Utterance: visit b while avoiding c visit c while avoiding a visit a while avoiding d visit d while avoiding h finally reach h
LTL: & U ! c b & U ! a c & U ! d a & U ! h d F h

Utterance: explore b c and a forever
LTL: & G F c & G F b G F a

Utterance: visit c b and a indefinitely
LTL: & G F c & G F b G F a

Utterance: never stop visiting a c d and b
LTL: & G F a & G F c & G F d G F b

Utterance: do not stop going to a b c and d in any order
LTL: & G F a & G F b & G F c G F d

Utterance: go to c a d b and h infinitely often
LTL: & G F c & G F a & G F d & G F b G F h

Utterance: do not stop visiting h c a d and b
LTL: & G F h & G F c & G F a & G F d G F b

Utterance: travel to a and b an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F a G F b

Utterance: keep visiting b and a in any order
LTL: & G F b G F a

Utterance:
