Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: reach a
LTL: F a

Utterance: go to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: go to a and go to b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: go to b and a in any order
LTL: & F b F a

Utterance: make sure c b and a are all visited
LTL: & F c & F b F a

Utterance: go to all of b c and a
LTL: & F b & F c F a

Utterance: make sure to visit c a b and d in any order
LTL: & F c & F a & F d F b

Utterance: go to a b c and d in any order
LTL: & F c & F a & F d F b

Utterance: reach the following five locations c a d b h
LTL: & F c & F a & F d & F b F h

Utterance: visit c h b d and a
LTL: & F c & F h & F b & F d F a

Utterance: go to b after going to a
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: go to b and then to a
LTL: F & b F a

Utterance: visit c b a one after the other
LTL: F & c F & b F a

Utterance: go to b c a make sure to go to c after b and a after c
LTL: F & b F & c F a

Utterance: visit c followed by b then b followed by d then d followed by a and then a
LTL: F & c F & b F & d F a

Utterance: visit d c a and b in this order there can be other locations in between
LTL: F & d F & c F & a F b

Utterance: visit c a d b and h in this order there can be other locations in between
LTL: F & c F & a F & d F & b F h

Utterance: visit c h b d and a in this order there can be other landmarks in between
LTL: F & c F & h F & b F & d F a

Utterance: visit c b and a where b does not proceed c and a does not proceed b
LTL: & U ! b c & U ! a b F a

Utterance: go to b at least once while avoiding c and a then go to c at least once while avoiding a finally go to a
LTL: & U ! c b & U ! a c F a

Utterance: visit a and only then reach b you can only visit a once
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: reach a exactly once while staying away from b then move to b
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: do not go to a until c is visited and do not go to c until b is visited along the path never return to previous location you have been to
LTL: & & U ! c b & U ! a c F a & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c a

Utterance: go to a only then go to c only then go to b while visiting a and c only once
LTL: & & U ! c a & U ! b c F b & U ! a U a U ! a c U ! c U c U ! c b

Utterance: do not go to d until a is visited and do not go to a until c is visited and do not go to c until b is visited along the path never return to previous location you have been to
LTL: & & U ! c b & U ! a c & U ! d a F d & U ! b U b U ! b c & U ! c U c U ! c a U ! a U a U ! a d

Utterance: do not visit b until you visit d visit d only once do not visit d until you visit c visit c only once do no visit c until you visit a visit a only once
LTL: & & U ! c a & U ! d c & U ! b d F b & U ! a U a U ! a c & U ! c U c U ! c d U ! d U d U ! d b

Utterance: go from h to a to b to c to d in that specific order and only visit each landmark one time
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! h U h U ! h a & U ! a U a U ! a b & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c d

Utterance: first visit d while avoiding b then visit b while avoiding c then visit c while avoiding a then visit a while avoiding h finally visit h visit each location once
LTL: & & U ! b d & U ! c b & U ! a c & U ! h a F h & U ! d U d U ! d b & U ! b U b U ! b c & U ! c U c U ! c a U ! a U a U ! a h

Utterance: visit a then visit b but do not visit b until you visit a
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: go from a to b do not go to b before visiting a
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: do not stop visiting a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: keep visiting a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: first go directly to c without visiting any other waypoints then go directly to d then directly to a and finally directly to b
LTL: & U ! d c & U ! a d & U ! b a F b

Utterance: visit b a d and c in that specific order make sure not to visit waypoints out of turn
LTL: & U ! a b & U ! d a & U ! c d F c

Utterance: visit a then c then b finally h you can not visit c before a you can not visit b before c you can not visit h before b you can not visit d before h
LTL: & U ! c a & U ! b c & U ! h b & U ! d h F d

Utterance: visit b only after b is visited go to d only after d is visited go to a only after a is visited go to h only after h is visited go to c
LTL: & U ! d b & U ! a d & U ! h a & U ! c h F c

Utterance: repeatedly keep visiting b c and a
LTL: & G F b & G F c G F a

Utterance: keep going to a b and c an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: keep going to c a d and b in any order
LTL: & G F c & G F a & G F d G F b

Utterance: you are prohibited from not infinitely going to b d c and a
LTL: & G F c & G F a & G F d G F b
