Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: move to a then move to b
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: eventually first visit a and then b after
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: visit a b and c one after another
LTL: F & a F & b F c

Utterance: visit a sometime afterwards visit b sometime afterwards visit c
LTL: F & a F & b F c

Utterance: make sure a b c and d are all visited in this order
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: visit a then visit b then visit c then visit d
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: you have to walk to a and then walk to b and then walk to c and then walk to d and finally walk to h
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F & d F h

Utterance: visit a b c d and h sequentially
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F & d F h

Utterance: find b but not until you find a first
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: do not visit b until you go to a
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: reach c but not until you visit a and b and that specific order
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: in strictly this order visit a then eventually visit b and finally eventually c
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: do not go to d until c is visited and do not go to c until b is visited and do not go to b until a is visited
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: visit a b c and d in that specific order make sure not to visit waypoints out of turn
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: do not go to h until d is visited and do not go to d until c is visited and do not go to c until b is visited and do not go to b until a is visited
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h

Utterance: go to a b c d and h in that specific order
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h

Utterance: move to a exactly once while avoiding b then find b
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: only visit a once and do not visit b until you visit a
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: go to a but do not visit b or c and then go to b but do not visit c or revisit a and then go to c but do not revisit a or b
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U !a b U ! b U b U !b c

Utterance: do not visit c until you visit b visit b only once do no visit b until you visit a visit a only once
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U !a b U ! b U b U !b c

Utterance: go to a but do not visit b c or d and then go to b but do not visit c or d or revisit a and then go to c but do not visit d or revisit a or b and then go to d but do not revisit a b or c
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c U ! c U c U !c d

Utterance: do not visit d until you visit c visit c only once do not visit c until you visit b visit b only once do no visit b until you visit a visit a only once
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c U ! c U c U !c d

Utterance: visit a then b then c then d and then h visit each landmark only once
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c & U ! c U c U !c d U ! d U d U !d h

Utterance: do not visit h until you visit d visit d only once do not visit d until you visit c visit c only once do not visit c until you visit b visit b only once do no visit b until you visit a visit a only once
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c & U ! c U c U !c d U ! d U d U !d h
