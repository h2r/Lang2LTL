Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: go to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: move to a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: do not stop until c b and a are visited
LTL: & F c & F b F a

Utterance: stop by d c b and a in any order
LTL: & F d & F c & F b F a

Utterance: go to h b d c and a in any order
LTL: & F a & F d & F b & F c F h

Utterance: go to b and move on to a once you have been to b
LTL: F & b F a

Utterance: make your way to c a and b consecutively
LTL: F & c F & a F b

Utterance: travel to c then travel to d then go to b then reach a
LTL: F & c F & d F & b F a

Utterance: reach b d c h and a sequentially
LTL: F & b F & d F & c F & h F a

Utterance: first go to c then go to a only after c finally go to b only after a
LTL: & U ! a c & U ! b a F b

Utterance: go to b and only then go to a without returning to b
LTL: & & U ! a b F a U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: go to a but not through b or c and then go to b but not through c and finally go to c no revisiting is allowed
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U ! a b U ! b U b U ! b c

Utterance: visit d only once while avoiding b then visit b once while avoiding a only after visiting a once visit c
LTL: & & U ! b d & U ! a b & U ! c a F c & U ! d U d U ! d b & U ! b U b U ! b a U ! a U a U ! a c

Utterance: go to h once without visiting b then go to b once without visiting d then go to d once without visiting a then go to a once without visiting c finally go to c
LTL: & & U ! b h & U ! d b & U ! a d & U ! c a F c & U ! h U h U ! h b & U ! b U b U ! b d & U ! d U d U ! d a U ! a U a U ! a c

Utterance: go to a while avoiding b then go to b
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: continue moving to a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: reach b without going to c then go to c without passing d then go to d without passing a finally go to a
LTL: & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! a d F a

Utterance: visit h then b then d finally a you can not visit b before h you can not visit d before b you can not visit a before d you can not visit c before a
LTL: & U ! b h & U ! d b & U ! a d & U ! c a F c

Utterance: do not stop visiting a b and c
LTL: & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: keep going to d a c and b
LTL: & G F d & G F a & G F c G F b

Utterance: continue visiting c h a b and d an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F c & G F h & G F a & G F b G F d

Utterance: keep going back and forth between b and a
LTL: & G F b G F a

Utterance:
