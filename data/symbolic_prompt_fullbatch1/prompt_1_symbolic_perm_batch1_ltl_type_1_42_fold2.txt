Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: go to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: move to a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: visit a b and c in any order
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: visit b d a and c in no particular order
LTL: & F b & F d & F a F c

Utterance: reach h a b c and d in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: after you have been to b make your way to a
LTL: F & b F a

Utterance: reach c then reach b then reach a
LTL: F & c F & b F a

Utterance: visit b followed by c then c followed by a then a followed by d and then d
LTL: F & b F & c F & a F d

Utterance: visit c h a d and b sequentially
LTL: F & c F & h F & a F & d F b

Utterance: visit b but before visiting b you must visit a visit each location once
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: only visit c once followed by visiting a then visiting b once
LTL: & & U ! a c & U ! b a F b & U ! c U c U ! c a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: head to d c a and b in this order without skipping or revisiting any one of them
LTL: & & U ! c d & U ! a c & U ! b a F b & U ! d U d U ! d c & U ! c U c U ! c a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: go to c only then go to b only then go to h only then go to a and only then go to d make sure to not revisit any of the locations before completing the task
LTL: & & U ! b c & U ! h b & U ! a h & U ! d a F d & U ! c U c U ! c b & U ! b U b U ! b h & U ! h U h U ! h a U ! a U a U ! a d

Utterance: keep visiting a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: never stop visiting b c and a
LTL: & G F b & G F c G F a

Utterance: keep going to d c b and a in any order
LTL: & G F d & G F c & G F b G F a

Utterance: do not go to d c h b and a c finite number of times
LTL: & G F c & G F a & G F d & G F h G F b

Utterance: keep going to b and a an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F b G F a

Utterance:
