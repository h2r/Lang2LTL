LTL: & F h & F c & F a & F d F b

Utterance: visit c but only after visiting a and visit a only after visiting b
LTL: & U ! a b & U ! c a F c

Utterance: you must visit b exactly once while avoiding a then you can navigate to a

Utterance: do not visit a until you visit c visit c only once do no visit c until you visit b visit b only once
LTL: & & U ! c b & U ! a c F a & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c a

Utterance: go to c but not through b d or a and then go to b but not through d or a and then go to d but not through a and finally go to a no revisiting is allowed
LTL: & & U ! b c & U ! d b & U ! a d F a & U ! c U c U ! c b & U ! b U b U ! b d U ! d U d U ! d a

Utterance: before visiting a h b and c visit d and never visit it again then visit a before h b and c and never visit it again do not visit b and c until you visit h never visit h again then visit b before c and never visit c again finally visit c
LTL: & & U ! a d & U ! h a & U ! b h & U ! c b F c & U ! d U d U ! d a & U ! a U a U ! a h & U ! h U h U ! h b U ! b U b U ! b c

Utterance: go to b then a you can not visit a before b
LTL: & U ! a b F a

Utterance: continue moving to a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: do not visit successor without visiting the predecessor in the following strict order c a d and b
LTL: & U ! a c & U ! d a & U ! b d F b

Utterance: do not go to c until h is visited and do not go to h until d is visited and do not go to d until a is visited and do not go to a until b is visited
LTL: & U ! a b & U ! d a & U ! h d & U ! c h F c

Utterance: never stop visiting c b and a
LTL: & G F c & G F b G F a

Utterance: visit locations a d c and b an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F a & G F d & G F c G F b
