Utterance: first go to b then go to a only after b
LTL: & U ! a b F a

Utterance: please keep visiting a without stopping

Utterance: visit c do not visit d h b or a until you visit c then visit d do not visit h b or a until you visit d then visit h do not visit b or a until you visit h then visit b do not visit a until you visit b finally reach a
LTL: & U ! d c & U ! h d & U ! b h & U ! a b F a

Utterance: keep going to b a and c an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F b & G F a G F c

Utterance: please keep visiting b a c and d without stopping
LTL: & G F b & G F a & G F c G F d

Utterance: do not go to d h b a and c h finite number of times
LTL: & G F h & G F c & G F d & G F b G F a

Utterance: at any point in time you must visit b and a at least once after
