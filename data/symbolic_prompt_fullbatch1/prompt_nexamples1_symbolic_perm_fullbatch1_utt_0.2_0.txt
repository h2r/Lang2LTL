Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: stop at a
LTL: F a

Utterance: visit a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: go to c b and a in any order
LTL: & F c & F b F a

Utterance: visit c a d and b
LTL: & F a & F c & F d F b

Utterance: find the following c a d b h
LTL: & F c & F a & F d & F b F h

Utterance: eventually first visit a and then b after
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: go to c then b then a
LTL: F & c F & b F a

Utterance: go to a then go to b then go to d and then go to c
LTL: F & a F & b F & d F c

Utterance: head to c and then to a after c is visited and then to d after a is visited and then to b after d is visited and then to h after b is visited
LTL: F & c F & a F & d F & b F h

Utterance: do not go to b until you visit c and do not go to c until you visit a and make sure you visit b
LTL: & U ! c a & U ! b c F b

Utterance: go to b without visiting a then go to a without going to b again
LTL: & & U ! a b F a U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: only visit c once followed by visiting b then visiting a once
LTL: & & U ! b c & U ! a b F a & U ! c U c U ! c b U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: visit c then d then a then b follow this strict order and visit each location only once
LTL: & & U ! d c & U ! a d & U ! b a F b & U ! c U c U ! c d & U ! d U d U ! d a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: visit c followed by visiting h then visit d a and b in this exact order visit all locations once
LTL: & & U ! h c & U ! d h & U ! a d & U ! b a F b & U ! c U c U ! c h & U ! h U h U ! h d & U ! d U d U ! d a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: go from a to b do not go to b before visiting a
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: keep visiting a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: go to a only after that go to d only then go to b and only then go to c
LTL: & U ! d a & U ! b d & U ! c b F c

Utterance: go to h and only go to d only after h is visited and then go to b only after h and d are both visited and then go to a only after h d and b are all visited and then go to c only after h d b and a are all visited
LTL: & U ! d h & U ! b d & U ! a b & U ! c a F c

Utterance: explore b c and a forever
LTL: & G F c & G F b G F a

Utterance: never stop visiting a c d and b
LTL: & G F a & G F c & G F d G F b

Utterance: go to c a d b and h infinitely often
LTL: & G F c & G F a & G F d & G F b G F h

Utterance: travel to a and b an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F a G F b
