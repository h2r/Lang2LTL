LTL: & F b & F d & F a F c

Utterance: go to b h c a and d
LTL: & F h & F b & F a & F d F c

Utterance: eventually first visit a and then b after
LTL: F & a F b

LTL: F & d F & h F & c F & a F b

Utterance: first go to a then go to c only after a finally go to b only after c
LTL: & U ! c a & U ! b c F b

Utterance: you must visit a exactly once while avoiding b then you can navigate to b
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: visit a once while staying away from b then visit b once while staying away from c finally visit c
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U ! a b U ! b U b U ! b c

Utterance: do not visit b until you visit c visit c only once do not visit c until you visit d visit d only once do no visit d until you visit a visit a only once
LTL: & & U ! d a & U ! c d & U ! b c F b & U ! a U a U ! a d & U ! d U d U ! d c U ! c U c U ! c b

Utterance: eventually visit c afterward eventually visit a afterward eventually visit d afterward eventually visit b afterward eventually visit h visit each landmark only once
LTL: & & U ! a c & U ! d a & U ! b d & U ! h b F h & U ! c U c U ! c a & U ! a U a U ! a d & U ! d U d U ! d b U ! b U b U ! b h

Utterance: go to a but do not go to a until you go to b first
LTL: & U ! a b F a

Utterance: please keep visiting a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: first go directly to d without visiting any other waypoints then go directly to a then directly to c and finally directly to b
LTL: & U ! a d & U ! c a & U ! b c F b

Utterance: visit d do not visit b c h or a before visiting d then visit b do not visit c h or a before visiting b then visit c do not visit h or a before visiting c then visit h do not visit a before visiting h finally visit a
LTL: & U ! b d & U ! c b & U ! h c & U ! a h F a

Utterance: travel to b a and c infinitely
LTL: & G F c & G F b G F a

Utterance: continue visiting d b c and a an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F d & G F b & G F c G F a

Utterance: keep visiting a c d h and b in any order infinitely
LTL: & G F a & G F c & G F d & G F h G F b

Utterance: keep going back and forth between b and a
LTL: & G F b G F a
