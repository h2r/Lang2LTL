Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: visit b and then a
LTL: F & b F a

Utterance: visit c at least once after going to b and visit a at least once after going to c
LTL: F & b F & c F a

Utterance: first go to a then visit b then move to c finally reach d
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: visit d followed by b then h then a and then c
LTL: F & d F & b F & h F & a F c

Utterance: go to c but not through b or a and then go to b but not through a and finally go to a
LTL: & U ! b c & U ! a b F a

Utterance: do not visit b before you visit a and then go to b without revisiting a
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: visit a exactly once do not visit c or b before a then visit c exactly once do not visit b before c finally visit b
LTL: & & U ! c a & U ! b c F b & U ! a U a U ! a c U ! c U c U ! c b

Utterance: go to c but do not visit b a or d and then go to b but do not visit a or d or revisit c and then go to a but do not visit d or revisit c or b and then go to d but do not revisit c b or a
LTL: & & U ! b c & U ! a b & U ! d a F d & U ! c U c U ! c b & U ! b U b U ! b a U ! a U a U ! a d

Utterance: visit c followed by visiting h then visit a b and d in this exact order visit all locations once
LTL: & & U ! h c & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! d b F d & U ! c U c U ! c h & U ! h U h U ! h a & U ! a U a U ! a b U ! b U b U ! b d

Utterance: go from a to b do not go to b before visiting a
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: do not stop visiting a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: go to d but not through a c or b and then go to a but not through c or b and then go to c but not through b and finally go to b
LTL: & U ! a d & U ! c a & U ! b c F b

Utterance: visit h a c b and d in this order without skipping any one of them
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! c a & U ! b c & U ! d b F d

Utterance: visit c b and a indefinitely
LTL: & G F c & G F b G F a

Utterance: continue visiting b c a and d an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F b & G F c & G F a G F d

Utterance: go to d a c h and b an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F d & G F b & G F c & G F a G F h

Utterance: keep going between a and b
LTL: & G F a G F b

Utterance:
