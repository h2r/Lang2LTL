Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: travel to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: navigate to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: go to a and b in any order
LTL: & F b F a

Utterance: stop by a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: go to b a and c
LTL: & F b & F a F c

Utterance: eventually reach c b and a
LTL: & F c & F a F b

Utterance: stop by d b a and c in any order
LTL: & F d & F b & F a F c

Utterance: make sure b d c and a are all visited
LTL: & F b & F d & F c F a

Utterance: make sure you go to d b c a h in any order
LTL: & F d & F b & F c & F a F h

Utterance: go to b c a d and h
LTL: & F c & F b & F d & F h F a

Utterance: visit b then visit a
LTL: F & b F a

Utterance: go to b after visiting a
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: visit a at least once after going to b and visit c at least once after going to a
LTL: F & b F & a F c

Utterance: go to c and then go to a and then go to b
LTL: F & c F & a F b

Utterance: visit a d c and b one after another
LTL: F & a F & d F & c F b

Utterance: head to a and then to b after a is visited and then to c after b is visited and then to d after c is visited
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: visit d then b then c then a and finally h
LTL: F & d F & b F & c F & a F h

Utterance: visit c followed by b then b followed by d then d followed by h then h followed by a and then a
LTL: F & c F & b F & d F & h F a

Utterance: visit a only then should you visit c and only after that should you reach b
LTL: & U ! c a & U ! b c F b

Utterance: visit a first while avoiding b and then move to b while avoiding c then visit c
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: you must visit b exactly once while avoiding a then you can navigate to a
LTL: & & U ! a b F a U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: only visit a once then visit b only after visiting a
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: go to b but not through a or c and then go to a but not through c and finally go to c no revisiting is allowed
LTL: & & U ! a b & U ! c a F c & U ! b U b U ! b a U ! a U a U ! a c

Utterance: visit b once while staying away from a then visit a once while staying away from c finally visit c
LTL: & & U ! a b & U ! c a F c & U ! b U b U ! b a U ! a U a U ! a c

Utterance: visit d but before visiting d you must visit a only after that visit c after visiting c visit b visit each location once
LTL: & & U ! d a & U ! c d & U ! b c F b & U ! a U a U ! a d & U ! d U d U ! d c U ! c U c U ! c b

Utterance: go to a but not through b d or c and then go to b but not through d or c and then go to d but not through c and finally go to c no revisiting is allowed
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! d b & U ! c d F c & U ! a U a U ! a b & U ! b U b U ! b d U ! d U d U ! d c

Utterance: visit h only once then eventually visit c only once then visit a in the future for one time followed by one visit to b and after that d
LTL: & & U ! c h & U ! a c & U ! b a & U ! d b F d & U ! h U h U ! h c & U ! c U c U ! c a & U ! a U a U ! a b U ! b U b U ! b d

Utterance: visit b c d h and a once do not visit c without visiting b and do not visit d without visiting c also do not visit h without visiting d and do not visit a without visiting h
LTL: & & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d & U ! a h F a & U ! b U b U ! b c & U ! c U c U ! c d & U ! d U d U ! d h U ! h U h U ! h a

Utterance: visit b only after visiting a
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: find a but not until you find b first
LTL: & U ! a b F a

Utterance: visit a an infinite number of times
LTL: G F a

Utterance: you must visit a infinitely often
LTL: G F a

Utterance: go to b then a then d finally c you can not visit a before b you can not visit d before a you can not visit c before d
LTL: & U ! a b & U ! d a & U ! c d F c

Utterance: visit a before visiting d c and b then visit d before visiting c b and then visit c before visiting b finally reach b
LTL: & U ! d a & U ! c d & U ! b c F b

Utterance: visit b then d then c then a then h while ensuring not to visit d before b not to visit c before d not to visit a before c not to visit h before a
LTL: & U ! d b & U ! c d & U ! a c & U ! h a F h

Utterance: ensure that you visit c but only after h in turn only visit h after b only visit b after a and only visit a after d
LTL: & U ! a d & U ! b a & U ! h b & U ! c h F c

Utterance: do not stop going to a c and b
LTL: & G F c & G F b G F a

Utterance: make sure a b and c are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: explore b d and a endlessy
LTL: & G F d & G F b & G F a G F c

Utterance: visit locations b d c and a an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F b & G F d & G F c G F a

Utterance: keep visiting d b c a and h an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F d & G F b & G F c & G F a G F h

Utterance: keep visiting c b d h and a in any order infinitely
LTL: & G F c & G F b & G F d & G F h G F a

Utterance: keep going between b and a
LTL: & G F b G F a

Utterance: do not stop visiting b and a
LTL: & G F b G F a

Utterance:
