Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: visit a
LTL: F a

Utterance: go to one of b and a and then to the other
LTL: & F b F a

Utterance: stop by b a and c in any order
LTL: & F b & F a F c

Utterance: visit a followed by b
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: go to b then go to c then go to a
LTL: F & b F & c F a

Utterance: visit a then d then c and then b
LTL: F & a F & d F & c F b

Utterance: go to a then go to c and then reach d then reach b and finally go to h
LTL: F & a F & c F & d F & b F h

Utterance: first go to c while staying away from a then go to a while staying away from b finally visit b
LTL: & U ! a c & U ! b a F b

Utterance: reach b exactly once while staying away from a then move to a
LTL: & & U ! a b F a U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: go to b but do not visit a c d or h and then go to a but do not visit c d or h or revisit b and then go to c but do not visit d or h or revisit b or a and then go to d but do not visit h or revisit b a or c and then go to h but do not revisit b a c or d
LTL: & & U ! a b & U ! c a & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! b U b U ! b a & U ! a U a U ! a c & U ! c U c U ! c d U ! d U d U ! d h

Utterance: go from a to b do not go to b before visiting a
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: never stop visiting a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: visit c without visiting b then visit b without visiting a then visit a without visiting d finally visit d
LTL: & U ! b c & U ! a b & U ! d a F d

Utterance: at any point in time ensure that you will visit a c and b at least once in the future
LTL: & G F a & G F c G F b

Utterance: frequent c a d and b infinitely in any order
LTL: & G F c & G F a & G F d G F b

Utterance: frequent b and a infinitely in any order
LTL: & G F b G F a

Utterance:
