Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: navigate to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: go to b and a in any order
LTL: & F b F a

Utterance: eventually reach c a and b
LTL: & F c & F b F a

Utterance: in no particular order visit b d a and c
LTL: & F b & F d & F a F c

Utterance: find the following d b c h a
LTL: & F d & F b & F c & F h F a

Utterance: go to b and sometime afterward visit a
LTL: F & b F a

Utterance: visit c followed by b which is then to be followed by a
LTL: F & c F & b F a

Utterance: go to a then c then d and then b
LTL: F & a F & c F & d F b

Utterance: you have to walk to h and then walk to d and then walk to b and then walk to c and finally walk to a
LTL: F & h F & d F & b F & c F a

Utterance: visit b at least once then visit c at least once finally visit a do not visit c or a before b do not visit a before c
LTL: & U ! c b & U ! a c F a

Utterance: reach b and then a in that exact order without repetitions
LTL: & & U ! a b F a U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: visit a exactly once while avoiding b and c then visit b exactly once while avoiding c finally visit c
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U ! a b U ! b U b U ! b c

Utterance: go to d but not through c a or b and then go to c but not through a or b and then go to a but not through b and finally go to b no revisiting is allowed
LTL: & & U ! c d & U ! a c & U ! b a F b & U ! d U d U ! d c & U ! c U c U ! c a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: first visit h while avoiding d then visit d while avoiding a then visit a while avoiding b then visit b while avoiding c finally visit c visit each location once
LTL: & & U ! d h & U ! a d & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! h U h U ! h d & U ! d U d U ! d a & U ! a U a U ! a b U ! b U b U ! b c

Utterance: find a while avoiding b then after finding a go to b
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: you must visit a infinitely often
LTL: G F a

Utterance: visit a d c and b in this strict order once the predecessor is visited you must visit the successor
LTL: & U ! d a & U ! c d & U ! b c F b

Utterance: visit b c h a and d in this order without skipping any one of them
LTL: & U ! c b & U ! h c & U ! a h & U ! d a F d

Utterance: continuously move to a c and b
LTL: & G F b & G F c G F a

Utterance: go to c d a and b over and over again
LTL: & G F c & G F d & G F a G F b

Utterance: do not stop visiting d h a b and c in no specific order
LTL: & G F d & G F h & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: go to b and a infinitely often
LTL: & G F b G F a

Utterance:
