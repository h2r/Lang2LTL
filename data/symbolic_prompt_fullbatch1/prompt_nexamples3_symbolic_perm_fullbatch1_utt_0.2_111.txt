Utterance: go to a but not through c or b and then go to c but not through b and finally go to b
LTL: & U ! c a & U ! b c F b

Utterance: you must visit b exactly once while avoiding a then you can navigate to a
LTL: & & U ! a b F a U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: only visit a once then visit b only after visiting a
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: reach b exactly once while staying away from a then move to a
LTL: & & U ! a b F a U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: go to b but not through a or c and then go to a but not through c and finally go to c no revisiting is allowed
LTL: & & U ! a b & U ! c a F c & U ! b U b U ! b a U ! a U a U ! a c

Utterance: visit b once while staying away from a then visit a once while staying away from c finally visit c
LTL: & & U ! a b & U ! c a F c & U ! b U b U ! b a U ! a U a U ! a c

Utterance: do not go to c until a is visited and do not go to a until b is visited along the path never return to previous location you have been to
LTL: & & U ! a b & U ! c a F c & U ! b U b U ! b a U ! a U a U ! a c

Utterance: visit d but before visiting d you must visit a only after that visit c after visiting c visit b visit each location once

Utterance: go to a but not through b d or c and then go to b but not through d or c and then go to d but not through c and finally go to c no revisiting is allowed
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! d b & U ! c d F c & U ! a U a U ! a b & U ! b U b U ! b d U ! d U d U ! d c

Utterance: visit each of b a d and c exactly once in this order
LTL: & & U ! a b & U ! d a & U ! c d F c & U ! b U b U ! b a & U ! a U a U ! a d U ! d U d U ! d c

Utterance: visit h only once then eventually visit c only once then visit a in the future for one time followed by one visit to b and after that d
