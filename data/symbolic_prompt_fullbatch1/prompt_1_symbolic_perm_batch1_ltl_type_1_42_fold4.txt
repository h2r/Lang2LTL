Utterance: stop by a
LTL: F a

Utterance: move to a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: go to a c and b
LTL: & F a & F c F b

Utterance: stop by a b c and d in any order
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: visit d a b c h in any order required
LTL: & F d & F a & F b & F c F h

Utterance: go to a after going to b
LTL: F & b F a

Utterance: go to b then head to a finally go to c
LTL: F & b F & a F c

Utterance: first go to b then visit c then move to d finally reach a
LTL: F & b F & c F & d F a

Utterance: you have to walk to b and then walk to d and then walk to a and then walk to c and finally walk to h
LTL: F & b F & d F & a F & c F h

Utterance: go to b but not through a or c and then go to a but not through c and finally go to c
LTL: & U ! a b & U ! c a F c

Utterance: visit a but do not visit a before you reach b
LTL: & U ! a b F a

Utterance: go to a an infinite number of times
LTL: G F a

Utterance: first go to a while avoiding d then go to d while staying away from b then go to b while staying away from c then visit c
LTL: & U ! d a & U ! b d & U ! c b F c

Utterance: visit a while avoiding h visit h while avoiding d visit d while avoiding b visit b while avoiding c finally reach c
LTL: & U ! h a & U ! d h & U ! b d & U ! c b F c

Utterance: repeatedly keep visiting a c and b
