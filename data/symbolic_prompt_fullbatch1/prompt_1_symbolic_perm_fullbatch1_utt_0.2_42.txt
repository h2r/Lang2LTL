LTL: F & a F & c F & d F & h F b

Utterance: visit a at least once do not visit b or c before a then visit b at least once do not visit c before b finally visit c

Utterance: go to a without visiting b then go to b without going to a again
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: go to c but not through b or a and then go to b but not through a and finally go to a no revisiting is allowed
LTL: & & U ! b c & U ! a b F a & U ! c U c U ! c b U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: head to b c a and d in this order without skipping or revisiting any one of them
LTL: & & U ! c b & U ! a c & U ! d a F d & U ! b U b U ! b c & U ! c U c U ! c a U ! a U a U ! a d

Utterance: visit d followed by visiting c then visit h b and a in this exact order visit all locations once
LTL: & & U ! c d & U ! h c & U ! b h & U ! a b F a & U ! d U d U ! d c & U ! c U c U ! c h & U ! h U h U ! h b U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: you must visit b first before going to a
LTL: & U ! a b F a

Utterance: patrol a repeatedly

Utterance: visit b do not visit d a h or c until you visit b then visit d do not visit a h or c until you visit d then visit a do not visit h or c until you visit a then visit h do not visit c until you visit h finally reach c
LTL: & U ! d b & U ! a d & U ! h a & U ! c h F c

Utterance: keep going to a b and c an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: do not stop going to d c b and a in any order
