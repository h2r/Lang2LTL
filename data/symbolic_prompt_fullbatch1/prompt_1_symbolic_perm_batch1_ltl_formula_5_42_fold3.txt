Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: make your way to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: visit b and a
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: do not stop until b a and c are visited
LTL: & F b & F a F c

Utterance: go to a b d and c in arbitrary order
LTL: & F a & F b & F d F c

Utterance: in no particular order visit b c h a d
LTL: & F b & F c & F h & F a F d

Utterance: make sure to go to b after you visit a
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: go to h then go to a then go to c then go to d finally go to b
LTL: F & h F & a F & c F & d F b

Utterance: go to a but not through b or c and then go to b but not through c and finally go to c
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: visit a exactly once while avoiding c and b then visit c exactly once while avoiding b finally visit b
LTL: & & U ! c a & U ! b c F b & U ! a U a U ! a c U ! c U c U ! c b

Utterance: go to d without visiting a then go to a without visiting b then go to b without visiting c finally go to c while only visiting each location once
LTL: & & U ! a d & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! d U d U ! d a & U ! a U a U ! a b U ! b U b U ! b c

Utterance: visit h then d then b then c and then a visit each landmark only once
LTL: & & U ! d h & U ! b d & U ! c b & U ! a c F a & U ! h U h U ! h d & U ! d U d U ! d b & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c a

Utterance: go to a repeatedly
LTL: G F a

Utterance: visit a before visiting d c and b then visit d before visiting c b and then visit c before visiting b finally reach b
LTL: & U ! d a & U ! c d & U ! b c F b

Utterance: only after you visit c you can go to a only after you visit a you can go to h only after you visit h you can go to d only after you visit d you can go to b
LTL: & U ! a c & U ! h a & U ! d h & U ! b d F b

Utterance: repeatedly keep visiting a c and b
LTL: & G F a & G F c G F b

Utterance: frequent c b a d and h infinitely in any order
LTL: & G F c & G F b & G F a & G F d G F h

Utterance: do not stop visiting b and a
LTL: & G F b G F a
