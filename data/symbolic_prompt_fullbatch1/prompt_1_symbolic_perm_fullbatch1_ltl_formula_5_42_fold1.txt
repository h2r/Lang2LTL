Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: travel to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: visit both a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: when you have the chance can you go to b a and c
LTL: & F b & F c F a

Utterance: find b first then find a
LTL: F & b F a

Utterance: go to b and then go to a and then go to c
LTL: F & b F & a F c

Utterance: visit b c d and a one after another
LTL: F & b F & c F & d F a

Utterance: make sure h d c a and b are all visited in this order there can be other locations in between
LTL: F & h F & d F & c F & a F b

Utterance: first go to c then go to a only after c finally go to b only after a
LTL: & U ! a c & U ! b a F b

Utterance: visit a and b in that exact sequence out of sequence visits and repeated visits are not permitted
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: do not visit c until you visit b visit b only once do not visit b until you visit h visit h only once do not visit h until you visit a visit a only once do no visit a until you visit d visit d only once
LTL: & & U ! a d & U ! h a & U ! b h & U ! c b F c & U ! d U d U ! d a & U ! a U a U ! a h & U ! h U h U ! h b U ! b U b U ! b c

Utterance: ensure that you do not reach a before going to b
LTL: & U ! a b F a

Utterance: keep visiting a forever
LTL: G F a

Utterance: visit b as many times as you want while avoiding a d and c then visit a as many times as you want while avoiding d and c then visit d as many times as you want while avoiding c finally visit c
LTL: & U ! a b & U ! d a & U ! c d F c

Utterance: keep going to c a and b an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F c & G F a G F b

Utterance: do not stop going to c b d and a in any order
LTL: & G F c & G F b & G F d G F a

Utterance: keep visiting a and b an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F a G F b

Utterance:
