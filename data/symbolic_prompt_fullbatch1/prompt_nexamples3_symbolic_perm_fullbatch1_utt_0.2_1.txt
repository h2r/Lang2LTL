Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: eventually you must go to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: stop at a
LTL: F a

Utterance: walk to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: move to a and b in any order
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: go to b and a
LTL: & F b F a

Utterance: visit b and a in any order
LTL: & F b F a

Utterance: go to c a and b
LTL: & F c & F a F b
