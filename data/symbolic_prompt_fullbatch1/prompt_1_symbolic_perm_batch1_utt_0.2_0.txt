Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: navigate to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: move to a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: go to the following locations c a and b
LTL: & F c & F a F b

Utterance: visit c b d and a the order is not important
LTL: & F c & F b & F d F a

Utterance: visit all locations d c a b h
LTL: & F d & F c & F a & F b F h

Utterance: after you visit a go to b
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: visit b then visit c then reach a
LTL: F & b F & c F a

Utterance: ensure that you visit b c d and a in order
LTL: F & b F & c F & d F a

Utterance: visit d followed by a then c then b and then h
LTL: F & d F & a F & c F & b F h

Utterance: visit a at least once do not visit b or c before a then visit b at least once do not visit c before b finally visit c
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: move to b exactly once while avoiding a then find a
LTL: & & U ! a b F a U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: visit a exactly once while avoiding b and c then visit b exactly once while avoiding c finally visit c
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U ! a b U ! b U b U ! b c

Utterance: visit b then c then a and then d you can only visit each landmark once
LTL: & & U ! c b & U ! a c & U ! d a F d & U ! b U b U ! b c & U ! c U c U ! c a U ! a U a U ! a d

Utterance: don not stop visiting c d and b
LTL: & & U ! d c & U ! b d & U ! a b & U ! h a F h & U ! c U c U ! c d & U ! d U d U ! d b & U ! b U b U ! b a U ! a U a U ! a h

Utterance: go to a after going to b do not go to a before
LTL: & U ! a b F a

Utterance: make sure you visit a infinite times
LTL: G F a

Utterance: visit d a c and b in this strict order once the predecessor is visited you must visit the successor
LTL: & U ! a d & U ! c a & U ! b c F b

Utterance: go to b and only go to c only after b is visited and then go to a only after b and c are both visited and then go to d only after b c and a are all visited and then go to h only after b c a and d are all visited
LTL: & U ! c b & U ! a c & U ! d a & U ! h d F h

Utterance: continuously move to a b and c
LTL: & G F c & G F b G F a

Utterance: keep visiting d c b and a in no specific order
LTL: & G F d & G F c & G F b G F a

Utterance: keep visiting a h d b and c an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F a & G F h & G F d & G F b G F c

Utterance: frequent a and b infinitely in any order
LTL: & G F a G F b

Utterance:
