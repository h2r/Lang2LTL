Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: stop by a

Utterance: in any order you like go to c b and a
LTL: & F c & F b F a

Utterance: visit a c b and d in any order
LTL: & F a & F c & F b F d

Utterance: go to b go to d go to h go to c go to a
LTL: & F b & F d & F h & F c F a

Utterance: go to a then go to b
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: go to a c b make sure to go to c after a and b after c
LTL: F & a F & c F b

Utterance: you have to walk to d and then walk to c and then walk to a and finally walk to b
LTL: F & d F & c F & a F b

Utterance: visit d at least once after visiting a visit b at least once after visiting both a and d visit h at least once after visiting a d and b and visit c at least once after visiting a d b and h
LTL: F & a F & d F & b F & h F c

Utterance: visit b only then should you visit c and only after that should you reach a
LTL: & U ! c b & U ! a c F a

Utterance: move to b exactly once while avoiding a then find a
LTL: & & U ! a b F a U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: visit c only once without visiting a then visit a one time without visiting b finally visit b in the future
LTL: & & U ! a c & U ! b a F b & U ! c U c U ! c a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: visit b d a and c in this order without skipping any one of them do not revisit any one of them once after you have been there
LTL: & & U ! d b & U ! a d & U ! c a F c & U ! b U b U ! b d & U ! d U d U ! d a U ! a U a U ! a c

Utterance: visit h followed by visiting d then visit b a and c in this exact order visit all locations once
LTL: & & U ! d h & U ! b d & U ! a b & U ! c a F c & U ! h U h U ! h d & U ! d U d U ! d b & U ! b U b U ! b a U ! a U a U ! a c

Utterance: visit a and visit b only if a is visited
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: reach c without going to a then go to a without passing b then go to b without passing d finally go to d
LTL: & U ! a c & U ! b a & U ! d b F d

Utterance: visit a h c b and d in this strict order once the predecessor is visited you must visit the successor
LTL: & U ! h a & U ! c h & U ! b c & U ! d b F d
