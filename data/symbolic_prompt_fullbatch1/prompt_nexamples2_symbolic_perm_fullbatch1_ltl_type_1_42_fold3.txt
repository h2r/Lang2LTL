Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: go to a then b
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: move to b then move to a
LTL: F & b F a

Utterance: go to c and go to a after c is visited and go to b after c and a are visited
LTL: F & c F & a F b

Utterance: in some sequence visit a b and c in that order
LTL: F & a F & b F c

Utterance: head to d and then to a after d is visited and then to b after a is visited and then to c after b is visited
LTL: F & d F & a F & b F c

Utterance: visit a then visit b then visit d then visit c
LTL: F & a F & b F & d F c

Utterance: visit h then a then c then d and finally b
LTL: F & h F & a F & c F & d F b

Utterance: reach h a b c and d sequentially
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: do not go to b until you visit a and do not go to a until you visit c and make sure you visit b
LTL: & U ! a c & U ! b a F b

Utterance: in strictly this order visit a then eventually visit b and finally eventually c
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: visit a first then visit b while only visiting each location once
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: move to b exactly once while avoiding a then find a
LTL: & & U ! a b F a U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: visit b exactly once while avoiding c and a then visit c exactly once while avoiding a finally visit a
LTL: & & U ! c b & U ! a c F a & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c a

Utterance: go to b but not through a or c and then go to a but not through c and finally go to c no revisiting is allowed
LTL: & & U ! a b & U ! c a F c & U ! b U b U ! b a U ! a U a U ! a c

Utterance: visit c only once while avoiding b then visit b once while avoiding d only after visiting d once visit a
LTL: & & U ! b c & U ! d b & U ! a d F a & U ! c U c U ! c b & U ! b U b U ! b d U ! d U d U ! d a

Utterance: go to b but not through c d or a and then go to c but not through d or a and then go to d but not through a and finally go to a no revisiting is allowed
LTL: & & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! a d F a & U ! b U b U ! b c & U ! c U c U ! c d U ! d U d U ! d a

Utterance: visit h while staying away from a then visit a while staying away from c then visit c while staying away from d then visit d while staying away from b finally reach b without returning to any previously visited locations
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! c a & U ! d c & U ! b d F b & U ! h U h U ! h a & U ! a U a U ! a c & U ! c U c U ! c d U ! d U d U ! d b

Utterance: go to h but not through a b c or d and then go to a but not through b c or d and then go to b but not through c or d and then go to c but not through d and finally go to d no revisiting is allowed here
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! h U h U ! h a & U ! a U a U ! a b & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c d

Utterance: visit a and b but do not visit b without visiting a
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: first go to b while avoiding a then move to a
LTL: & U ! a b F a

Utterance: please keep visiting a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: do not stop visiting a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: do not visit successor without visiting the predecessor in the following strict order c b d and a
LTL: & U ! b c & U ! d b & U ! a d F a

Utterance: visit a but do not visit a until you have reached d in turn only go to d after you visit c and only go to c after reaching b
LTL: & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! a d F a

Utterance: visit h a b c and d in this order without skipping any one of them
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: go to h but not through b a c or d and then go to b but not through a c or d and then go to a but not through c or d and then go to c but not through d and finally go to d
LTL: & U ! b h & U ! a b & U ! c a & U ! d c F d

Utterance: keep visiting c a and b in any order
LTL: & G F c & G F a G F b

Utterance: frequent a b and c infinitely in any order
LTL: & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: keep visiting d a b and c in any order
LTL: & G F d & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: frequent a b d and c infinitely in any order
LTL: & G F a & G F b & G F d G F c

Utterance: keep visiting h a c d and b an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F c & G F d G F b

Utterance: make sure h a b c and d are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F b & G F c G F d

Utterance: keep going to a and b an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F a G F b

Utterance: at any point in time you must visit b and a at least once after
LTL: & G F b G F a

Utterance:
