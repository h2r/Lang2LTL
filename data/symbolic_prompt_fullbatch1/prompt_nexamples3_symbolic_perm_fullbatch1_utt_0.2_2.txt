Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: walk to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: navigate to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: stop at a
LTL: F a

Utterance: go to b and a in any order
LTL: & F b F a

Utterance: go to b and a in any order
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: move to a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: go to the following locations a c and b
LTL: & F a & F c F b

Utterance: visit a c and b in no specific order
LTL: & F c & F b F a

Utterance: when you have the chance can you go to b a and c
LTL: & F b & F c F a

Utterance: go to four locations d c b and a
LTL: & F d & F c & F a F b

Utterance: go to b d c and a in any order
LTL: & F c & F b & F a F d

Utterance: go to four locations c d a and b
LTL: & F c & F d & F b F a

Utterance: do not stop until h a b c and d are all visited

Utterance: go to d h c a and b in arbitrary order
LTL: & F d & F h & F c & F a F b

Utterance: visit d h c b and a in any order
LTL: & F d & F h & F c & F b F a

Utterance: go to b and then to a
LTL: F & b F a

Utterance: visit a then visit b
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: visit a followed by b

Utterance: visit a then visit c then reach b
LTL: F & a F & c F b

Utterance: in some sequence visit c b and a in that order
LTL: F & c F & b F a

Utterance: reach b then reach c and then reach a
LTL: F & b F & c F a

Utterance: eventually in some sequence visit c d a and b each must be followed by the next

Utterance: visit h then visit a then visit b then visit c finally visit d
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: make sure d h c a and b are all visited in this order there can be other locations in between
LTL: F & d F & h F & c F & a F b

Utterance: first go to d then move to h then go visit c then visit b finally reach a
LTL: F & d F & h F & c F & b F a

Utterance: go to a at least once while avoiding b and c then go to b at least once while avoiding c finally go to c

LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: go to b and only then go to a without returning to b
LTL: & & U ! a b F a U ! b U b U ! b a

Utterance: visit a exactly once avoid b or c before a then reach b exactly once avoid c before b finally move to c
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U ! a b U ! b U b U ! b c

Utterance: visit b once while staying away from a then visit a once while staying away from c finally visit c

Utterance: visit d then a then c and then b you can only visit each landmark once
LTL: & & U ! a d & U ! c a & U ! b c F b & U ! d U d U ! d a & U ! a U a U ! a c U ! c U c U ! c b

Utterance: stay away from b c and d until you make a single visit to a and then make your way to b while staying away from a c and d and then make your way to c while staying away from a b or d and finally make your way to d while staying away from a b and c
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! a U a U ! a b & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c d

Utterance: please go to d then b then c then a in that specific order without revisiting previously visited location
