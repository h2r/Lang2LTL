Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: visit a c and b in any order
LTL: & F a & F c F b

Utterance: move to a c d and b in any order
LTL: & F a & F c & F d F b

Utterance: make your way to h b a d and c
LTL: & F h & F b & F a & F d F c

Utterance: move to c then move to a finally reach b
LTL: F & c F & a F b

Utterance: go to d then go to c then go to b and then go to a
LTL: F & d F & c F & b F a

Utterance: visit c a and b in order but keep avoiding latter ones when you are heading to former ones
LTL: & U ! a c & U ! b a F b

Utterance: reach a and then b in that exact order without repetitions
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: go to a only then go to c only then go to b while visiting a and c only once
LTL: & & U ! c a & U ! b c F b & U ! a U a U ! a c U ! c U c U ! c b

Utterance: visit a b c d once do not visit b without visiting a and do not visit b without visiting c do not visit d without visiting c
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! a U a U ! a b & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c d

Utterance: go to a and only then go to b
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: first go to d while avoiding c then go to c while staying away from a then go to a while staying away from b then visit b
LTL: & U ! c d & U ! a c & U ! b a F b

Utterance: visit b h a c and d in that specific order ensure to not visit locations out of turn
LTL: & U ! h b & U ! a h & U ! c a & U ! d c F d

Utterance: keep visiting c b and a
LTL: & G F b & G F a G F c

Utterance: make sure b a c and d are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F b & G F a & G F c G F d

Utterance: you can not stop traveling to h c d b and a
LTL: & G F c & G F b & G F h & G F a G F d

Utterance: never stop visiting b and a
LTL: & G F b G F a

Utterance:
