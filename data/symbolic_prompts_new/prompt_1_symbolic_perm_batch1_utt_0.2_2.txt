Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: go to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: visit b and a
LTL: & F b F a

Utterance: go to the following locations a c and b
LTL: & F a & F c F b

Utterance: go to c go to d got to a and go to b
LTL: & F c & F d & F a F b

Utterance: reach the following five locations c a h b d
LTL: & F c & F a & F h & F b F d

Utterance: visit a and then b
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: visit c at least once after going to a and visit b at least once after going to c
LTL: F & a F & c F b

Utterance: reach c then reach d then reach b and then reach a
LTL: F & c F & d F & b F a

Utterance: visit d b c a and h in this order there can be other landmarks in between
LTL: F & d F & b F & c F & a F h

Utterance: visit b but do not visit b before you reach a
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: visit b a and c in order but keep avoiding latter ones when you are heading to former ones
LTL: & U ! a b & U ! c a F c

Utterance: make your way to a only after going to d before that make your way to d only after going to b before that make your way to b only after going to c
LTL: & U ! b c & U ! d b & U ! a d F a

Utterance: before visiting b c a and h visit an and never visit it again then visit b before c a and h and never visit it again do not visit a and h until you visit c never visit c again then visit a before h and never visit h again finally visit h
LTL: & U ! b d & U ! c b & U ! a c & U ! h a F h

Utterance: visit b but only after a also you cannot revisit a before completing the remaining tasks
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: go to b but do not visit c or a and then go to c but do not visit a or revisit b and then go to a but do not revisit b or c
LTL: & & U ! c b & U ! a c F a & U ! b U b U !b c U ! c U c U !c a

Utterance: visit c then a then b and then d you can only visit each landmark once
LTL: & & U ! a c & U ! b a & U ! d b F d & U ! c U c U !c a & U ! a U a U !a b U ! b U b U !b d

Utterance: go to h but do not visit b a d or c and then go to b but do not visit a d or c or revisit h and then go to a but do not visit d or c or revisit h or b and then go to d but do not visit c or revisit h b or a and then go to c but do not revisit h b a or d
LTL: & & U ! b h & U ! a b & U ! d a & U ! c d F c & U ! h U h U !h b & U ! b U b U !b a & U ! a U a U !a d U ! d U d U !d c

Utterance: make sure a is visited infinitely
LTL: G F a

Utterance: never stop visiting a and b
LTL: & G F a G F b

Utterance: keep visiting c b and a in any order
LTL: & G F c & G F b G F a

Utterance: make sure c a d and b are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F c & G F a & G F d G F b

Utterance: never stop visiting c a b d and h
LTL: & G F c & G F a & G F b & G F d G F h

Utterance:
