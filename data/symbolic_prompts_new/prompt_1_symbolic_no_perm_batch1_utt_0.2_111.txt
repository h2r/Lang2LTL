Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: find a
LTL: F a

Utterance: reach a reach b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: visit all three locations a b and c
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: move to abc and d in any order
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: go to a go to b go to c go to d go to h
LTL: & F a & F b & F c & F d F h

Utterance: move a then find b
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: visit b at least once after going to a and visit c at least once after going to b
LTL: F & a F & b F c

Utterance: reach a then reach b then reach c and then reach d
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: visit a then visit b then visit c then visit d and then visit h
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F & d F h

Utterance: ensure that you do not reach b before going to a
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: keep away from b and c while heading to a and then keep away from c while heading to b and eventually go to c
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: go to a only after that go to b only then go to c and only then go to d
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: ensure that you visit h but only after d in turn only visit d after c only visit c after b and only visit b after a
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h

Utterance: go to a only then go to b but ensure to not revisit a
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: go to a but not through b or c and then go to b but not through c and finally go to c no revisiting is allowed
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U !a b U ! b U b U !b c

Utterance: go to a but not through b c or d and then go to b but not through c or d and then go to c but not through d and finally go to d no revisiting is allowed
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c U ! c U c U !c d

Utterance: do not go to h until d is visited and do not go to d until c is visited and do not go to c until b is visited and do not go to b until a is visited along the path never return to previous location you have been to
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c & U ! c U c U !c d U ! d U d U !d h

Utterance: frequent a infinitely
LTL: G F a

Utterance: do not stop visiting a and b
LTL: & G F a G F b

Utterance: please keep visiting a b and c without stopping
LTL: & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: please keep visiting a b c and d without stopping
LTL: & G F a & G F b & G F c G F d

Utterance: please keep visiting a b c d and h without stopping
LTL: & G F a & G F b & G F c & G F d G F h

Utterance:
