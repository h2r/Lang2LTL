Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: eventually you must go to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: find a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: go to c a and b
LTL: & F c & F a F b

Utterance: visit c d a and b
LTL: & F d & F c & F a F b

Utterance: sometime visit a c h b and d
LTL: & F a & F h & F c & F d F b

Utterance: visit a and visit b after a is visited
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: visit c a and b in that order
LTL: F & c F & a F b

Utterance: you have to walk to d and then walk to b and then walk to a and finally walk to c
LTL: F & d F & b F & a F c

Utterance: visit d h c b and a sequentially
LTL: F & d F & h F & c F & b F a

Utterance: go to b and then go to a but do not visit a before b is visited
LTL: & U ! a b F a

Utterance: direct yourself to c but keep away from a and b then go to a but bypass b and eventually make you way at b
LTL: & U ! a c & U ! b a F b

Utterance: go to b and only go to a only after b is visited and then go to d only after b and a are both visited and then go to c only after b a and d are all visited
LTL: & U ! a b & U ! d a & U ! c d F c

Utterance: go to d h c b and a in that specific order
LTL: & U ! h d & U ! c h & U ! b c & U ! a b F a

Utterance: navigate to b exactly once while staying away from a then you can go to a
LTL: & & U ! a b F a U ! b U b U !b a

Utterance: visit b a and c in this order without skipping any one of them do not revisit any one of them once after you have been there
LTL: & & U ! a b & U ! c a F c & U ! b U b U !b a U ! a U a U !a c

Utterance: go to d but do not visit a b or c and then go to a but do not visit b or c or revisit d and then go to b but do not visit c or revisit d or a and then go to c but do not revisit d a or b
LTL: & & U ! a d & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! d U d U !d a & U ! a U a U !a b U ! b U b U !b c

Utterance: go to c but do not visit a d h or b and then go to a but do not visit d h or b or revisit c and then go to d but do not visit h or b or revisit c or a and then go to h but do not visit b or revisit c a or d and then go to b but do not revisit c a d or h
LTL: & & U ! a c & U ! d a & U ! h d & U ! b h F b & U ! c U c U !c a & U ! a U a U !a d & U ! d U d U !d h U ! h U h U !h b

Utterance: never stop visiting a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: keep going to b and a in arbitrary order
LTL: & G F b G F a

Utterance: frequent b a and c infinitely in any order
LTL: & G F b & G F a G F c

Utterance: frequent a b d and c infinitely in any order
LTL: & G F a & G F b & G F d G F c

Utterance: frequent c d h a and b infinitely in any order
LTL: & G F c & G F d & G F h & G F a G F b

Utterance:
