Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: stop by a
LTL: F a

Utterance: go to a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: in any order you like go to c a and b
LTL: & F c & F a F b

Utterance: move to b then move to a
LTL: F & b F a

Utterance: go to b  then visit c then reach a
LTL: F & b F & c F a

Utterance: go to b then go to c then go to d and then go to a
LTL: F & b F & c F & d F a

Utterance: you have to walk to h and then walk to c and then walk to a and then walk to d and finally walk to b
LTL: F & h F & c F & a F & d F b

Utterance: find a but not until you find b first
LTL: & U ! a b F a

Utterance: go to b but not through a or c and then go to a but not through c and finally go to c
LTL: & U ! a b & U ! c a F c

Utterance: move to b exactly once while avoiding a then find a
LTL: & & U ! a b F a U ! b U b U !b a

Utterance: visit c a and b in this order without skipping any one of them do not revisit any one of them once after you have been there
LTL: & & U ! a c & U ! b a F b & U ! c U c U !c a U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: visit d a c and b in this order without skipping any one of them do not revisit any one of them once after you have been there
LTL: & & U ! a d & U ! c a & U ! b c F b & U ! d U d U !d a & U ! a U a U !a c U ! c U c U !c b

Utterance: make your way to h only after going to d before that make your way to d only after going to a before that make your way to a only after going to b before that make your way to b only after going to c do not go back to the previous location you have visited while heading to the next
LTL: & & U ! b c & U ! a b & U ! d a & U ! h d F h & U ! c U c U !c b & U ! b U b U !b a & U ! a U a U !a d U ! d U d U !d h

Utterance: make sure b and a are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F b G F a

Utterance: make sure b a and c are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F b & G F a G F c

Utterance: never stop visiting h d a b and c
LTL: & G F h & G F d & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance:
