Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: go to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: make sure both a and b are visited
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: move to abc in any order
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: visit a b c and d in no particular order
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: find the following a b c d h
LTL: & F a & F b & F c & F d F h

Utterance: go to a then reach b
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: go to a  then visit b then reach c
LTL: F & a F & b F c

Utterance: visit a then visit b then visit c then visit d
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: visit a b c d and h in this order there can be other landmarks in between
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F & d F h

Utterance: go to b after going to a do not go to b before
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: in strictly this order visit a then eventually visit b and finally eventually c
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: visit a as many times as you want then visit b as many times but never visit a again then visit c as many times but never visit b again finally visit d
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: before visiting b c d and h visit an and never visit it again then visit b before c d and h and never visit it again do not visit d and h until you visit c never visit c again then visit d before h and never visit h again finally visit h
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h

Utterance: visit a and b in that exact sequence out of sequence visits and repeated visits are not permitted
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: do not go to c until b is visited and do not go to b until a is visited along the path never return to previous location you have been to
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U !a b U ! b U b U !b c

Utterance: do not go to d until c is visited and do not go to c until b is visited and do not go to b until a is visited along the path never return to previous location you have been to
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c U ! c U c U !c d

Utterance: do not visit h until you visit d visit d only once do not visit d until you visit c visit c only once do not visit c until you visit b visit b only once do no visit b until you visit a visit a only once
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c & U ! c U c U !c d U ! d U d U !d h

Utterance: make sure a is visited infinitely
LTL: G F a

Utterance: keep visiting a and b in any order
LTL: & G F a G F b

Utterance: keep visiting a b and c in any order
LTL: & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: keep visiting a b c and d in any order
LTL: & G F a & G F b & G F c G F d

Utterance: keep visiting a b c d h in any order
LTL: & G F a & G F b & G F c & G F d G F h

Utterance:
