Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: go to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: reach a
LTL: F a

Utterance: find a
LTL: F a

Utterance: eventually reach a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: go to a and b in any order
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: stop by a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: visit a b and c in any order
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: go to the following locations a b and c
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: in any order you like go to a b and c
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: make your way to a b c and d
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: move to abc and d in any order
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: go to a b c and d in arbitrary order
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: visit all locations a b c d h
LTL: & F a & F b & F c & F d F h

Utterance: visit a b c d h in any order required

LTL: F & a F & b F & c F & d F h

Utterance: visit b only after visiting a
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: go to a and only then go to b
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: head to a first and then to b but do not visit b if you havent been to a
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: keep away from b and c while heading to a and then keep away from c while heading to b and eventually go to c
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: go to a only then go to b and only then go to c
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: direct yourself to a but keep away from b and c then go to b but bypass c and eventually make you way at c
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: go to a only after that go to b only then go to c and only then go to d
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: do not go to d until c is visited and do not go to c until b is visited and do not go to b until a is visited
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: go to a and only go to b only after a is visited and then go to c only after a and b are both visited and then go to d only after a b and c are all visited
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: ensure that you visit h but only after d in turn only visit d after c only visit c after b and only visit b after a
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h

Utterance: do not go to h until d is visited and do not go to d until c is visited and do not go to c until b is visited and do not go to b until a is visited
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h

Utterance: go to a and only go to b only after a is visited and then go to c only after a and b are both visited and then go to d only after a b and c are all visited and then go to h only after a b c and d are all visited
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h

Utterance: move to a exactly once while avoiding b then find b
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: visit b but only after a also you cannot revisit a before completing the remaining tasks
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: do not visit h until you visit d visit d only once do not visit d until you visit c visit c only once do not visit c until you visit b visit b only once do no visit b until you visit a visit a only once
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c & U ! c U c U !c d U ! d U d U !d h

Utterance: go to a but not through b c d or h and then go to b but not through c d or h and then go to c but not through d or h and then go to d but not through h and finally go to h no revisiting is allowed here
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c & U ! c U c U !c d U ! d U d U !d h
