Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: navigate to a
LTL: F a

Utterance: go to a then go to b or go to b then go to a
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: go to a b and c
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: do not stop until a b c and d are all visited
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: do not stop until a b c d and h are all visited
LTL: & F a & F b & F c & F d F h

Utterance: eventually first visit a and then b after
LTL: F & a F b

Utterance: make your way to a b and c consecutively
LTL: F & a F & b F c

Utterance: go to a then go to b then go to c and then go to d
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: go to a and then go to b and then go to c and then go to d and then go to h
LTL: F & a F & b F & c F & d F h

Utterance: first go to a while avoiding b then move to b
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: go to a but not through b or c and then go to b but not through c and finally go to c
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: go to a but not through b c or d and then go to b but not through c or d and then go to c but not through d and finally go to d
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: go to a but not through b c d or h and then go to b but not through c d or h and then go to c but not through d or h and then go to d but not through h and finally go to h
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h

Utterance: you must visit a exactly once while avoiding b then you can navigate to b
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: visit a exactly once while avoiding b and c then visit b exactly once while avoiding c finally visit c
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U !a b U ! b U b U !b c

Utterance: visit a then b then c and then d you can only visit each landmark once
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c U ! c U c U !c d

Utterance: do not go to h until d is visited and do not go to d until c is visited and do not go to c until b is visited and do not go to b until a is visited along the path never return to previous location you have been to
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c & U ! c U c U !c d U ! d U d U !d h

Utterance: please visit a infinitely often
LTL: G F a

Utterance: please keep visiting a and b without stopping
LTL: & G F a G F b

Utterance: never stop visiting a b and c
LTL: & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: never stop visiting a b c and d
LTL: & G F a & G F b & G F c G F d

Utterance: never stop visiting a b c d and h
LTL: & G F a & G F b & G F c & G F d G F h
