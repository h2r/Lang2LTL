Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: go to b
LTL: F b

Utterance: make sure both b and h are visited
LTL: & F b F h

Utterance: eventually, reach h, b, and a
LTL: & F h & F a F b

Utterance: in no particular order, visit h, a, b, and c
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: eventually go visit h, a, d, c, and b
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: after you visit b, go to h

Utterance: go to h, and then go to a, and then go to b
LTL: F & h F & a F b

Utterance: first go to a. then visit b. then move to c. finally, reach d.

Utterance: visit h, then visit a, then visit b, then visit c, and then visit d
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: first go to h while staying away from b. then, go to c while staying away from c. finally, visit a.

Utterance: eventually visit a. afterward, eventually visit b. afterward, eventually visit c. afterward, eventually visit d. afterward, eventually visit h. visit each landmark only once.
