Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: stop by a
LTL: F a

Utterance: go to a and b
LTL: & F a F b

Utterance: when you have the chance can you go to a c and b
LTL: & F a & F b F c

Utterance: go to a go to b got to c and go to d
LTL: & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: visit a b c d and h
LTL: & F a & F b & F c & F d F h

Utterance: find b but not until you find a first
LTL: & U ! b a F b

Utterance: reach c but not until you visit a and b and that specific order
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: do not go to d until c is visited and do not go to c until b is visited and do not go to b until a is visited
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: do not go to h until d is visited and do not go to d until c is visited and do not go to c until b is visited and do not go to b until a is visited
LTL: & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h

Utterance: move to a exactly once while avoiding b then find b
LTL: & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b

Utterance: go to a but do not visit b or c and then go to b but do not visit c or revisit a and then go to c but do not revisit a or b
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U !a b U ! b U b U !b c

Utterance: go to a but do not visit b c or d and then go to b but do not visit c or d or revisit a and then go to c but do not visit d or revisit a or b and then go to d but do not revisit a b or c
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c U ! c U c U !c d

Utterance: visit a then b then c then d and then h visit each landmark only once
LTL: & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c & U ! c U c U !c d U ! d U d U !d h

Utterance: do not stop visiting a
LTL: G F a

Utterance: make sure a and b are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F a G F b

Utterance: never stop visiting a b and c
LTL: & G F a & G F b G F c

Utterance: never stop visiting a b c and d
LTL: & G F a & G F b & G F c G F d

Utterance: never stop visiting a b c d and h
LTL: & G F a & G F b & G F c & G F d G F h
