Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: reach d
LTL: F d

Utterance: go to d and c in any order
LTL: & F d F c

Utterance: you must go to c h and a at least once
LTL: & F h & F a F c

Utterance: visit h go to a reach c reach d
LTL: & F h & F a & F c F d

Utterance: make sure you go to h a c d b in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F c & F d F b

Utterance: visit h but before visiting h you must visit b visit each location once
LTL: & & U ! h b F h U ! b U b U ! b h

Utterance: do not go to b until a is visited and do not go to a until h is visited along the path never return to previous location you have been to
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! b a F b & U ! h U h U ! h a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: do not go to c until b is visited and do not go to b until a is visited and do not go to a until h is visited along the path never return to previous location you have been to
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! h U h U ! h a & U ! a U a U ! a b U ! b U b U ! b c

Utterance: visit h while staying away from a then visit a while staying away from c then visit c while staying away from d then visit d while staying away from b finally reach b without returning to any previously visited locations
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! c a & U ! d c & U ! b d F b & U ! h U h U ! h a & U ! a U a U ! a c & U ! c U c U ! c d U ! d U d U ! d b

Utterance: please visit d infinitely often
LTL: G F d

Utterance: travel to a c and h infinitely
LTL: & G F h & G F a G F c

Utterance: keep visiting h a c and d an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F c G F d

Utterance: keep visiting h a c d and b an infinite number of times
LTL: & G F h & G F a & G F c & G F d G F b

Utterance: make sure b and h are visited infinitely
LTL: & G F b G F h

Utterance: never visit b
LTL: G ! b

Utterance: make sure to never reach either b or h
LTL: & G ! b G ! h

Utterance: you can not go to h a or c
LTL: & G ! h & G ! a G ! c

Utterance: you can not go to h a c or d
LTL: & G ! h & G ! a & G ! c G ! d

Utterance: you can not go to h a c d or b
LTL: & G ! h & G ! a & G ! c & G ! d G ! b

Utterance: h must be observed before visiting b
LTL: U ! b h

Utterance: once you reach b you are never allowed to visit it again
LTL: ! F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: you can visit b at most twice
LTL: ! F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: passing through b thrice will lock it for future visits
LTL: ! F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: visiting b for the fourth time will lock it for future visits
LTL: ! F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: you can not visit b six or more times
LTL: ! F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: visit b at least once
LTL: F b

Utterance: visit b at least twice while leaving its region in between
LTL: F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: you can not visit d less than three times
LTL: F & d U d & ! d U ! d F & d U d & ! d U ! d F d

Utterance: you are not allowed to visit b three times or fewer you must visit b four times or more
LTL: F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: you must visit and then leave b at least five times
LTL: F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F & b U b & ! b U ! b F b

Utterance: visit b then leave b and never go back
LTL: M b | ! b G | b G ! b

Utterance: go to b then leave b and repeat this exactly once more
LTL: M & b F & ! b F b | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G ! b

Utterance: you are required to visit b on exactly three separate instances
LTL: M & b F & ! b F & b F & ! b F b | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G ! b

Utterance: you are required to make exactly four separate visits to b
LTL: M & b F & ! b F & b F & ! b F & b F & ! b F b | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G ! b

Utterance: complete exactly five separate visits to b
LTL: M & b F & ! b F & b F & ! b F & b F & ! b F & b F & ! b F b | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G | ! b G | b G ! b

Utterance: once b is reached after that you can never visit h
LTL: G i b X G ! h

Utterance: if b is observed at any time then h must be visited in the future
LTL: G i b F h

Utterance: h must occur in the very next time step that b occurs and b must happen in the immediately previous time step of h occurring
LTL: G e b X h

Utterance: as soon as b is observed visit h at the next time instant
LTL: G i b X h

Utterance: as long as you do not see b happen do not leave a
LTL:
U a b
G ! b U a a
