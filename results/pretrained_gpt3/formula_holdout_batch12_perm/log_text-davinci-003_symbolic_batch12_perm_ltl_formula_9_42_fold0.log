Utterance: first go to h while staying away from a then go to a while staying away from c finally visit c
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! c a F c

Utterance: visit h but before visiting h you must visit b visit each location once
LTL: & & U ! h b F h U ! b U b U ! b h

Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: reach d
LTL: F d

Utterance: go to d and c in any order
LTL: & F d F c

Utterance: you must go to c h and a at least once
LTL: & F h & F a F c

Utterance: visit h go to a reach c reach d
LTL: & F h & F a & F c F d

Utterance: find d first then find c
LTL: F & d F c

Utterance: go to h then go to a then go to c
LTL: F & h F & a F c

Utterance: first go to h then visit a then move to c finally reach d
LTL: F & h F & a F & c F d

Utterance: visit h then a then c then d and finally b
LTL: F & h F & a F & c F & d F b

Utterance: first go to h while staying away from a then go to a while staying away from c finally visit c
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! c a F c

Utterance: visit h but before visiting h you must visit b visit each location once
LTL: & & U ! h b F h U ! b U b U ! b h

Utterance: do not go to b until a is visited and do not go to a until h is visited along the path never return to previous location you have been to
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! b a F b & U ! h U h U ! h a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: visit h while staying away from a then visit a while staying away from c then visit c while staying away from d then visit d while staying away from b finally reach b without returning to any previously visited locations

Utterance: please visit d infinitely often
LTL: G F d

Utterance: first go directly to h without visiting any other waypoints then go directly to a then directly to b and finally directly to c

Utterance: first go to h while staying away from a then go to a while staying away from c finally visit c
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! c a F c

Utterance: visit h but before visiting h you must visit b visit each location once
LTL: & & U ! h b F h U ! b U b U ! b h

Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: reach d

Utterance: visit h go to a reach c reach d
LTL: & F h & F a & F c F d

Utterance: find d first then find c
LTL: F & d F c

Utterance: go to h then go to a then go to c
LTL: F & h F & a F c

Utterance: first go to h then visit a then move to c finally reach d
LTL: F & h F & a F & c F d

Utterance: visit h then a then c then d and finally b
LTL: F & h F & a F & c F & d F b

Utterance: first go to h while staying away from a then go to a while staying away from c finally visit c
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! c a F c

Utterance: visit h but before visiting h you must visit b visit each location once
LTL: & & U ! h b F h U ! b U b U ! b h

Utterance: do not go to b until a is visited and do not go to a until h is visited along the path never return to previous location you have been to
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! b a F b & U ! h U h U ! h a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: visit h while staying away from a then visit a while staying away from c then visit c while staying away from d then visit d while staying away from b finally reach b without returning to any previously visited locations

Utterance: please visit d infinitely often
LTL: G F d

Utterance: first go directly to h without visiting any other waypoints then go directly to a then directly to b and finally directly to c
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: visit h a b c and d in this order without skipping any one of them
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: first go to h while staying away from a then go to a while staying away from c finally visit c
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! c a F c

Utterance: visit h but before visiting h you must visit b visit each location once
LTL: & & U ! h b F h U ! b U b U ! b h

Utterance: do not go to b until a is visited and do not go to a until h is visited along the path never return to previous location you have been to
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! b a F b & U ! h U h U ! h a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: visit h while staying away from a then visit a while staying away from c then visit c while staying away from d then visit d while staying away from b finally reach b without returning to any previously visited locations

Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: reach d
LTL: F d

Utterance: go to d and c in any order
LTL: & F d F c

Utterance: you must go to c h and a at least once
LTL: & F h & F a F c

Utterance: visit h go to a reach c reach d
LTL: & F h & F a & F c F d

Utterance: find d first then find c
LTL: F & d F c

Utterance: go to h then go to a then go to c
LTL: F & h F & a F c

Utterance: first go to h then visit a then move to c finally reach d
LTL: F & h F & a F & c F d

Utterance: visit h then a then c then d and finally b
LTL: F & h F & a F & c F & d F b

Utterance: first go to h while staying away from a then go to a while staying away from c finally visit c
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! c a F c

Utterance: visit h but before visiting h you must visit b visit each location once
LTL: & & U ! h b F h U ! b U b U ! b h

Utterance: do not go to b until a is visited and do not go to a until h is visited along the path never return to previous location you have been to
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! b a F b & U ! h U h U ! h a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: visit h while staying away from a then visit a while staying away from c then visit c while staying away from d then visit d while staying away from b finally reach b without returning to any previously visited locations

Utterance: go to d and then go to c but do not visit c before d is visited
LTL: & U ! c d F c

Utterance: please visit d infinitely often
LTL: G F d

Utterance: first go directly to h without visiting any other waypoints then go directly to a then directly to b and finally directly to c
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b F c

Utterance: visit h a b c and d in this order without skipping any one of them
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d

Utterance: h must occur in the very next time step that b occurs and b must happen in the immediately previous time step of h occurring
LTL: G e b X h

Utterance: remain at b till you observe h

Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: reach d
LTL: F d

Utterance: go to d and c in any order
LTL: & F d F c

Utterance: you must go to c h and a at least once
LTL: & F h & F a F c

Utterance: visit h go to a reach c reach d
LTL: & F h & F a & F c F d

Utterance: find d first then find c
LTL: F & d F c

Utterance: go to h then go to a then go to c
LTL: F & h F & a F c

Utterance: first go to h then visit a then move to c finally reach d
LTL: F & h F & a F & c F d

Utterance: visit h then a then c then d and finally b
LTL: F & h F & a F & c F & d F b

Utterance: first go to h while staying away from a then go to a while staying away from c finally visit c
LTL: & U ! a h & U ! c a F c

Utterance: visit h but before visiting h you must visit b visit each location once
LTL: & & U ! h b F h U ! b U b U ! b h

Utterance: do not go to b until a is visited and do not go to a until h is visited along the path never return to previous location you have been to
LTL: & & U ! a h & U ! b a F b & U ! h U h U ! h a U ! a U a U ! a b

Utterance: visit h while staying away from a then visit a while staying away from c then visit c while staying away from d then visit d while staying away from b finally reach b without returning to any previously visited locations

Utterance: please visit d infinitely often
LTL: G F d

Utterance: first go directly to h without visiting any other waypoints then go directly to a then directly to b and finally directly to c
