Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: go to b

Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: go to b

Utterance: in no particular order visit h a b and c
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: eventually go visit h a d c and b

Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: go to b

Utterance: in no particular order visit h a b and c
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: eventually go visit h a d c and b
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: after you visit b go to h
LTL: F & b F h

Utterance: go to h and then go to a and then go to b

Utterance: visit h then visit a then visit b then visit c and then visit d
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: first go to h while staying away from c then go to c while staying away from a finally visit a

Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: go to b

Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: go to b

Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: go to b
LTL: F b

Utterance: make sure both b and h are visited
LTL: & F b F h

Utterance: eventually reach h b and a

Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: go to b
LTL: F b

Utterance: make sure both b and h are visited
LTL: & F b F h

Utterance: eventually reach h b and a
LTL: & F h & F a F b

Utterance: in no particular order visit h a b and c
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: eventually go visit h a d c and b
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: after you visit b go to h
LTL: F & b F h

Utterance: go to h and then go to a and then go to b
LTL: F & h F & a F b

Utterance: first go to h then visit c then move to a finally reach d
LTL: F & h F & c F & a F d

Utterance: visit h then visit a then visit b then visit c and then visit d
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: first go to h while staying away from c then go to c while staying away from a finally visit a
LTL: & U ! c h & U ! a c F a

Utterance: visit b and h in that exact sequence out of sequence visits and repeated visits are not permitted
LTL: & & U ! h b F h U ! b U b U ! b h

Utterance: go to h only then go to c only then go to a while visiting h and c only once
LTL: & & U ! c h & U ! a c F a & U ! h U h U ! h c U ! c U c U ! c a

Utterance: go to h without visiting c then go to c without visiting a then go to a without visiting d finally go to d while only visiting each location once

Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: go to b
LTL: F b

Utterance: make sure both b and h are visited
LTL: & F b F h

Utterance: eventually reach h b and a
LTL: & F h & F a F b

Utterance: in no particular order visit h a b and c
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: eventually go visit h a d c and b
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: after you visit b go to h
LTL: F & b F h

Utterance: go to h and then go to a and then go to b
