LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: go to h c b d and a at least once
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: move to b then move to h

LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: go to h c b d and a at least once
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: move to b then move to h

Utterance: eventually reach b and h
LTL: & F b F h

Utterance: go to h a and b
LTL: & F h & F a F b

Utterance: make sure to visit h a c and b in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: go to h c b d and a at least once
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: move to b then move to h
LTL: F & b F h

Utterance: visit a at least once after going to h and visit b at least once after going to a
LTL: F & h F & a F b

Utterance: visit c at least once after visiting h visit a at least once after visiting h and c visit d at least once after visiting h c and a
LTL: F & h F & c F & a F d

Utterance: visit h followed by a then b then c and then d
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: visit h at least once then visit c at least once finally visit a do not visit c or a before h do not visit a before c
LTL: & U ! c h & U ! a c F a

Utterance: only visit b once and do not visit h until you visit b

Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: visit b
LTL: F b

Utterance: eventually reach b and h
LTL: & F b F h

Utterance: go to h a and b
LTL: & F h & F a F b

Utterance: make sure to visit h a c and b in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: go to h c b d and a at least once
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: move to b then move to h
LTL: F & b F h

Utterance: visit a at least once after going to h and visit b at least once after going to a
LTL: F & h F & a F b

Utterance: visit c at least once after visiting h visit a at least once after visiting h and c visit d at least once after visiting h c and a
LTL: F & h F & c F & a F d

Utterance: visit h followed by a then b then c and then d
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: visit h at least once then visit c at least once finally visit a do not visit c or a before h do not visit a before c
LTL: & U ! c h & U ! a c F a

Utterance: only visit b once and do not visit h until you visit b
LTL: & & U ! h b F h U ! b U b U ! b h

Utterance: visit c but before visiting c you must visit h only after that visit a visit each location once
LTL: & & U ! c h & U ! a c F a & U ! h U h U ! h c U ! c U c U ! c a

Utterance: go to h only once but keep away from c a and d and then go to c only once but keep away from h a and d and then go to a only once but keep way from h c and d and finally go to d once but keep away from h c and a
LTL: & & U ! c h & U ! a c & U ! d a F d & U ! h U h U ! h c & U ! c U c U ! c a U ! a U a U ! a d

LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: go to h c b d and a at least once
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: move to b then move to h

Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: visit b
LTL: F b

Utterance: eventually reach b and h
LTL: & F b F h

Utterance: go to h a and b
LTL: & F h & F a F b

Utterance: make sure to visit h a c and b in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: go to h c b d and a at least once
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: move to b then move to h

LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: go to h c b d and a at least once
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: move to b then move to h
