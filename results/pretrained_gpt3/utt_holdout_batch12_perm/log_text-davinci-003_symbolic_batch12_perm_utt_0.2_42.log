Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: visit b
LTL: F b

Utterance: reach b and h in any order
LTL: & F b F h

Utterance: visit h a and b in any order
LTL: & F h & F a F b

Utterance: visit h go to a reach b reach c
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: make sure you go to h a b c d in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: go to b then move to h
LTL: F & b F h

Utterance: make your way to h a and b consecutively
LTL: F & h F & a F b

Utterance: visit c at least once after visiting h visit a at least once after visiting h and c visit d at least once after visiting h c and a
LTL: F & h F & c F & a F d

Utterance: visit h then a then b then c and finally d
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: visit h at least once then visit c at least once finally visit a do not visit c or a before h do not visit a before c
LTL: & U ! c h & U ! a c F a

Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: visit b
LTL: F b

Utterance: reach b and h in any order
LTL: & F b F h

Utterance: visit h a and b in any order
LTL: & F h & F a F b

Utterance: visit h go to a reach b reach c
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: make sure you go to h a b c d in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: go to b then move to h
LTL: F & b F h

Utterance: make your way to h a and b consecutively
LTL: F & h F & a F b

Utterance: visit c at least once after visiting h visit a at least once after visiting h and c visit d at least once after visiting h c and a
LTL: F & h F & c F & a F d

Utterance: visit h then a then b then c and finally d
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: visit h at least once then visit c at least once finally visit a do not visit c or a before h do not visit a before c
LTL: & U ! c h & U ! a c F a

Utterance: visit h go to a reach b reach c
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: make sure you go to h a b c d in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: go to b then move to h

Utterance: reach b and h in any order
LTL: & F b F h

Utterance: visit h a and b in any order
LTL: & F h & F a F b

Utterance: visit h go to a reach b reach c
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: make sure you go to h a b c d in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: go to b then move to h

Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: visit b
LTL: F b

Utterance: reach b and h in any order
LTL: & F b F h

Utterance: visit h a and b in any order
LTL: & F h & F a F b

Utterance: visit h go to a reach b reach c
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: make sure you go to h a b c d in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: go to b then move to h

Utterance: visit h go to a reach b reach c
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: make sure you go to h a b c d in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: go to b then move to h
LTL: F & b F h

Utterance: make your way to h a and b consecutively
LTL: F & h F & a F b

Utterance: visit c at least once after visiting h visit a at least once after visiting h and c visit d at least once after visiting h c and a
LTL: F & h F & c F & a F d

Utterance: visit h then a then b then c and finally d
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: visit h at least once then visit c at least once finally visit a do not visit c or a before h do not visit a before c

Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: visit b
LTL: F b

Utterance: reach b and h in any order
LTL: & F b F h

Utterance: visit h a and b in any order
LTL: & F h & F a F b

Utterance: visit h go to a reach b reach c
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: make sure you go to h a b c d in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: go to b then move to h
LTL: F & b F h

Utterance: make your way to h a and b consecutively
LTL: F & h F & a F b

Utterance: visit c at least once after visiting h visit a at least once after visiting h and c visit d at least once after visiting h c and a
LTL: F & h F & c F & a F d

Utterance: visit h then a then b then c and finally d
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: visit h at least once then visit c at least once finally visit a do not visit c or a before h do not visit a before c

Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: visit b
LTL: F b

Utterance: reach b and h in any order
LTL: & F b F h

Utterance: visit h a and b in any order
LTL: & F h & F a F b

Utterance: visit h go to a reach b reach c
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: make sure you go to h a b c d in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b & F c F d

Utterance: go to b then move to h
LTL: F & b F h

Utterance: make your way to h a and b consecutively
LTL: F & h F & a F b

Utterance: visit c at least once after visiting h visit a at least once after visiting h and c visit d at least once after visiting h c and a
LTL: F & h F & c F & a F d

Utterance: visit h then a then b then c and finally d
