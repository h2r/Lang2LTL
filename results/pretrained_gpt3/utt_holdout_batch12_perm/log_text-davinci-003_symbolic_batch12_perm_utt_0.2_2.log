Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Utterance: head to b
LTL: F b

Utterance: go to b and h in any order
LTL: & F b F h

Utterance: move to h a and b in any order
LTL: & F h & F a F b

Utterance: stop by h a b and c in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: go to b and then to h
LTL: F & b F h

Utterance: reach h then reach a then reach b
LTL: F & h F & a F b

Utterance: travel from h to c to a to d and make sure to go to c after h a after c and d after a

Utterance: make sure h a b c and d are all visited in this order there can be other locations in between
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: go to c after you have visited h and go to a after you have visited c
LTL: & U ! c h & U ! a c F a

Utterance: reach h then reach a then reach b
LTL: F & h F & a F b

Utterance: travel from h to c to a to d and make sure to go to c after h a after c and d after a
LTL: F & h F & c F & a F d

Utterance: make sure h a b c and d are all visited in this order there can be other locations in between
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: go to c after you have visited h and go to a after you have visited c
LTL: & U ! c h & U ! a c F a

Utterance: make sure h a b c and d are all visited in this order there can be other locations in between
LTL: F & h F & a F & b F & c F d

Utterance: go to c after you have visited h and go to a after you have visited c
LTL: & U ! c h & U ! a c F a

LTL: & F h & F a F b

Utterance: stop by h a b and c in any order
LTL: & F h & F a & F b F c

Utterance: go to h a b c and d in arbitrary order
